## diferant methods of gold extractions from its ores
Gold extraction refers to the methods used to remove gold from its raw state in gold ore. A number of processes are employed to achieve extraction, including separating the gold from its surroundings by physical force, exposure to heat, or chemical means. The ore is typically mined first, though this is not always necessary, and then subjected

## Why Is Iron Ore Valuable? Behind the Scenes of Production
Feb 03, 2022Iron ore is a rock from which the metal iron is extracted. About 98% of the world's iron is used to produce steel. Pure iron is an element and a soft grayish-white metal. Other than meteorites that fall from the sky, iron is never found by itself in nature. Most iron is part of minerals that contain other elements.

## Extraction of Metals from Ores – Different Processes Involved
The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.

## extraction of iron ore 
Nov 12, 2021The minerals or iron ores have a complicated symbiotic relationship. Therefore, suitable iron extraction methods are essential for improving the recovery rate of iron concentrates. Common iron ores include magnetite, hematite, and limonite. In this passage, we will introduce you to the extraction methods of three types of common iron ore.

Iron ore sample found is a part of banded iron ore formation. Hematite and goethite are major constituents of iron ore samples. Hematite in the ore sample occurs as specularite with inter granular micro-pore spaces. Goethite is profuse and occurs as colloform product in cavities in addition with the weaker bedding planes.

the extraction of the rare earths from the slag generated. Hydrometallurgical methods were investigated for this purpose. In practice, smelting of the ore and solubilisation of the REO by mineral acid leaching is affected by the ore mineralogy and impurities. Ore mineralogy affects the kinetics of both smelting and leaching.

hydrometallurgical extraction of iron. The problems in iron extraction by this means have been: 1. The standard leaching method is dissolution of fully-oxidized ore by acid. However, iron oxidized to the Fe +3 (ferric) state requires a very acidic solution to dissolve, and this results in very high acid consumption. 2.
