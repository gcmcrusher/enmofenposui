## Thinning by Grinding Wheel (Grinding)
Grinding is a process for making board-shaped workpieces thin (approx. less than 1 mm thick) and flat by using a grinding wheel. The grinding wheel is an abrasive which uses synthetic diamond. Wheel segments (thickness: several millimeters, height: 3 – 5 mm) are arranged along a ring-shaped wheel base. There are various types of grinding

For wafers with diameters of 200 mm, it is typical to start with a wafer thickness of roughly 720 m and grind it to a thickness of 150 m or less. The coarse grinding typically removes approximately 90 percent of the excess material. A typical two-step backgrinding operation will use dual spindles with grinding wheels mounted on each spindle.

Nov 08, 2017Thin 50-m silicon wafers are used to improve heat dissipation of chips with high power densities. However, mechanical dicing methods cause chipping at the edges of the separated dies that reduce the mechanical stability. Thermal load changes may then lead to sudden chip failure. Recent investigations showed that the mechanical stability of the cut chips
