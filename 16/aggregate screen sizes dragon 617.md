Gradation, or particle size distribution, is the dispersal of individual particle sizes across the entire sample. Aggregate gradation is typically reported in graphical form by plotting each of the particle sizes on a semi-logarithmic chart and drawing a best-fit curve between the points. The full procedure is outlined in ASTM C136 (AASHTO T-27).
