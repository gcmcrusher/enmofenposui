20.07.2013Much as I hate to admit it, I'm old enough to remember a time before today's do-it-all automatic washing machines. My family had an electric wringer washer and doing laundry was a little more hands-on than it is today. I think the highlight of my young mother's life was getting a "real" electric washer that did all the work for her.

Dec 17, 2004I bought a Wonder Washer which is an egg shaped non- electric washing machine. It works really well! There is more work involved because you have to squeeze or wring the cloths yourself but since you're doing small loads at a time its not too hard. or if you are hang drying just hang them up drippy. It just takes longer to dry is all.
