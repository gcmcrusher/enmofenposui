## How Do Wind Turbines Work? 
A wind turbine turns wind energy into electricity using the aerodynamic force from the rotor blades, which work like an airplane wing or helicopter rotor blade. When wind flows across the blade, the air pressure on one side of the blade decreases. The difference in air pressure across the two sides of the blade creates both lift and drag.

22.02.2016These systems remove 90-93% of the contaminants (Clean Coal Technologies). Low-NO x Burners. The purpose of low NO x burners is to decrease the amount of NO x created when the coal is burned. This is done by injecting coal and air in boilers. This can result in 40-50% NO x reduction.

## Mining 
For coal mines, the economics of using ventilation exhaust air as an input to on-site electricity generation are constantly improving. Identifying areas of high-flow resistance (pinched ducts or pipes, sharp corners) can also add to savings. Relatively easy savings can also be achieved through maintenance improvements.
