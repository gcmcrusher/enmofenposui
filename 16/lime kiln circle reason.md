## Lime Kiln Dust 
Lime Kiln Dust will react with water, chemically absorbing water and, at the same time, producing heat which can cause evaporation. This allows the moisture content in wet and unworkable soils to be adjusted to a more optimum value. One common application would be a building site during a wet, rainy season.

2004. Description. Rotary kilns have wide use in industry from the calcination of limestone to cement manufacturing to calcining of petroleum coke etc. These machines have survived and have been continuously improved (fuel efficiency, automation) for over a century. Modelling has aided the design and operation of rotary kilns over the years.
