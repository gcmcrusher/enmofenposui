02.10.202022/07/2019 A mercury-gold amalgam then is formed because gold will dissolve in the mercury while other impurities will not. The mixture of gold and mercury is then heated to a temperature that will vaporize the mercury, leaving behind the gold. This process does not result in gold that is 100% pure, but it does eliminate the bulk of the impurities.

## Cyanide Leaching Of Gold 
The cyanide solution strength is also important in leaching gold, with the typical range of solution being in the 0.02% -0.05% NaCN. The gold particle size has a tremendous effect on the time required for dissolution in a cyanide solution. Generally, the finer the gold, the quicker it will dissolve. A 45 micron particle of gold would dissolve

## Solid
Solid-Liquid Extraction ((Leaching )) Leaching: is the separation of a solute from solid mixture by dissolving it in a liquid phase. Leaching occurs in two steps: 1. Contacting solvent and solid to effect a transfer of a solute (leaching). 2. The separation of the solution from the remaining solid (washing). Factors influencing the rate of
