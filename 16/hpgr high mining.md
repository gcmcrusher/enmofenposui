## Expert control for high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) improves 
Aug 15, 2022High pressure grinding rolls are steadily becoming ubiquitous in the copper mining industry, replacing the SAG mill grinding stage. The HPGR exposes feed material to very high pressure for a short amount of time. The compression typically causes the rock to crack and cleave along the grain boundaries, weakening the rock structure.

## HPGR Performance Comparison 
Jun 09, 2021HPGR Performance Comparison. Within communition circuits, High-Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR) are increasingly replacing traditional milling conventions such as (S)AG or rod and ball mills for hard rock reduction. This is, in part, due to their substantially lower energy consumption and potential for the high cost of ownership reduction.
