## Electric Motor Bearing Greasing and Lubrication
Most electric motors are designed with grease-lubricated, antifriction, rolling-element bearings. Grease is the lifeblood of these bearings because it provides an oil film that prevents the harsh metal-to-metal contact between the rotating element and races. Bearing troubles account for 50 to 65 percent of all electric motor failures, and poor lubrication practices account for most of these
