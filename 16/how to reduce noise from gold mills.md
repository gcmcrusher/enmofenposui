Mar 12, 2019Behavior of sound: When designing engineering control to reduce the noise exposure it is important to have basic understanding of sound and its impact. Sound is always produced by change in the speed or force. Basic principle of sound includes, 1) More noise is produced when great force is used for longer time than small force with shorter time.

Apr 11, 2012The amount of noise produced can be affected in a number of ways when the motor is controlled by a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD). For instance, operating the motor at a lower speed will usually reduce noise level, all other factors being equal. Also, owing to a given motor's design/construction, there may be frequencies, termed resonant
