## What is the purpose of anthracite in sand filters 
16.06.2004Anthracite is commonly used in industrial and municipal water filters. It is not as common in the swimming pool industry where silica sand is the predominant media. If you are looking for a replacement for anthracite sand, the closest material I can think of are the light-weight sands that are processed from volcanic pumas.

Quartz sand, silica sand, anthracite coal, garnet, magnetite, and other materials may be used as filtration media. Silica sand and anthracite are the most commonly used types. When silica is not suitable (e.g., in filters following a hot process softener where the treated water is intended for boiler feed), anthracite is usually used.
