## Coal Mining 
Coal mining operations generate a considerable amount of rocks (discarded mine stone), rejecting coal and fines that are produced during washing. These material excavation from the anoxic subsurface and transfer to the surface for the process. Residues from the mining contain various metals like Al, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, etc. (Silva et al., 2013 ).
