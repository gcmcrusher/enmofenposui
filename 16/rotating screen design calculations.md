The rotating siphon method stops working as soon as the air passes through the cake. It is generally known that water in larger capillaries is more readily removed than water in smaller capillaries. Therefore, air can pass through a cake very quickly (through the large capillaries) and nullify the pressure drop created by the rotating siphons.

## Dewatering Screens 
Counter-rotating vibratory motors (or mechanical exciters on the largest of Dewatering Screens) create a linear motion at an angle to the screen surface that accelerates the solids upward and forward at 5 G. This, along with a generous stroke length, moves water through the countless openings between the particles to promote droplet formation. The abrupt reversal of motion

23.01.2020Take the division of total costs by the average inventory and you will be presented with your inventory turnover. You should take this calculation of stock rotation, analyse your business, and draw conclusions about the operation of your company. Also, what will help is if your employees know exactly how to manage your stocks efficiently.

## Clamping Force Calculation 
R 1 = 1270 lbs. R 2 = 2790 lbs. In other words, the combined force from all clamps on the right side must be greater than 1290 lbs. We recommend a 2-to-1 safety factor (2580 lbs). Even though F L (the combined force from all clamps on the left side) equals zero, a small clamping force may be desirable to prevent vibration.
