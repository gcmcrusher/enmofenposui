Another variable that may be introduced into the operation of a pellet mill is the rotational speed of the die. For the production of small diameter pellets (i.e., 3 mm or less) high rotation speeds are used. This results in a thinner layer of soft feed inside the die ring ahead of the rolls, and for a given volume of feed the efficiency of pelleting and pellet hardness are improved. Die

## Ball milling 
A ball mill is simply a container that is filled with pebbles (either of porcelain or stones e.g. Flint) into which a charge (powder or slurry) is put and that is then mechanically rotated to cause the tumbling pebbles to crush particles that happen between them. Ball mills can be continuous or periodic, they can be small or gigantic, low speed
