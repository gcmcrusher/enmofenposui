## Magnetic Iron Ore Separator Thomas Edison
Iron Ore Magnetic Separator With Best Service. 8 Magnetic Ore separator 10 Inventions by Thomas Edison . Probably the biggest financial failure of Edisons career was the magnetic ore separator. The idea which Edisons laboratory experimented with during the 1880s and 1890s was to use magnets to separate iron ore from unusable lower grade ores.
