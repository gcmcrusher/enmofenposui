## Metallurgical coal 
Metallurgical (met) coal (or coking coal) is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock found within the earth's crust. Categories of met coal include hard coking coal, semi-hard coking-coal, semi-soft coking coal and pulverised coal for injection (PCI). These apply to the different quality grades of met coal, all of which are used to make steel.

power plant, less coal needs to be fired. This reduces the burden on the coal handling system, conveyers and crushers. Also, since dryer coal is easier to convey, this reduces maintenance costs and increases availability of the coal handling system. Crushed coal is fed into the bunkers from where it flows by gravity to the coal feeders.
