## Performance of Geopolymer Concrete at Elevated Temperature 
The expansion of aggregates usually predominates over the contraction of geopolymer which produces a net result of expansion in the composite. At 600oC the concrete lost 3.94% of its weight. At 800oC the weight loss was 5.81 % while at 1000oC the weight loss arrived to 8.5 %.

## Performance of cement concrete with mineral admixtures
Its resistance towards the Na 2 SO 4 expansion is on account of lower content of free Ca(OH) 2, besides the refinement of pore structure. Its lower resistance towards the strength reduction in MgSO 4 environment, like ordinary portland cement (PC), is attributed to the deleterious reaction of Mg ++ cations with C-S-H.

07.03.2017Excessive addition of gypsum produced a more porous matrix with a lower strength due to coarser and wider crystals in the gypsum.

12/03/20112. INTRODUCTION Gypsum is a mineral that is mined in various parts of the world. The word gypsum derived from Greek word meaning to cook referred to burnt or calcined mineral. Chemically it is CaSo4;2H2O i.e. calcium sulphate dihydrate. Three types of gypsum products are available in dentistry 1. Model plaster 2.

Expansion of CSA cement pastes increased with increasing gypsum in tests with both externally supplied water and without. When cured in water, the CSA cement paste with a molar ratio of 2 : 1 gypsum to ye'elimite had a much faster rate and magnitude of expansion; accordingly, it cracked severely after 1 d of water curing.
