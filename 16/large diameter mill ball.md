## small ball mill for cement Larger capacity
13/02/2017 the apparent difference in capacities between grinding mills (listed as being the same size) is due to the fact that there is no uniform method of designating the size of a mill, for example: a 5′ x 5′ ball mill has a working diameter of 5′ inside the liners and has 20 per cent more capacity than all other ball mills designated as 5′ x 5′ where

## How To Choose a Stepover for 3D Profiling 
To put real numbers on this, that would be equavalent to a .012, .025, and .042″ stepover for a .125″ ball mill. Stepover =1/10 of diameter. Stepover =1/5 of diameter. Stepover =1/3 of diameter. As you can see, the change in quality is so dramatic that you might be tempted to always use the smallest stepover possible.

As expected the fractions of 508 mm balls are lower for the 2 m diameter mills in all cases this confirms that it is desirable to reduce the size and amount of the larger balls for mills with larger diameters also the data for the mill with a 2 m diameter shows a linear relationship on a loglog scale this is expressed by eq.

## Early Experience with Large Balls Mills at Mount Lyell
Some twelve months of operation at Mount Lyell, using two large diameter ball mills as a two-stage grinding circuit indicated a short- fall in the grinding capability compared with design criteria. Breakage, particularly at coarser sizes, was less efficient than with the previously used grinding circuit comprising a large number of smaller diameter mills.

## Ball Milling 
Ball milling is a mechanical technique that is broadly used to grind powders into fine particles [134–141]. The reactants are generally broken apart using solvent molecules in the traditional method; but in ball milling, reactants are broken by using mechanical forces. The term mechanochemistry has been introduced very recently [142].
