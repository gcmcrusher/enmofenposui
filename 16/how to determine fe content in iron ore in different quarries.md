Iron (/ ˈ aɪ ər n /) is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26. It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table.It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, right in front of oxygen (32.1% and 30.1%, respectively), forming much of Earth's outer and inner core.It is the fourth most common

sintering: a step between mining iron ore and steelmaking. The USGS defines iron ore as a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (Fe2O3). Its a major ingredient in steel.

The Iron making is necessarily a reduction process, as far as the chemical theory is concerned, where reduction of the iron ores takes place to produce metallic iron. • Iron ores: Generally in Oxides: Hematite (Fe 2 O 3), Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) Mass number (55.85) Density=7.874g/cc Atomic number (26) m.p= 1538 C b.p= 2861 C Fe Iron (Latin

Hematite is the main iron ore. Iron may also be incorporated into one of the clay minerals to form other ore or into a carbonate mineral. Iron usually combines with oxygen to form Fe2O3 (hematite), one of the most common iron ore oxides. Laterites contain high concentrations of uranium series elements and are used to

C + O2 → CO2. The heat produced by this reaction is the main source of heat in the blast furnace that is used for iron production. At the bottom of the furnace, the temperature is very high, which causes more of the coke to react with carbon dioxide, producing carbon monoxide. C + CO2 → 2CO. The carbon monoxide then becomes the "reducing

## iron processing 
Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite
