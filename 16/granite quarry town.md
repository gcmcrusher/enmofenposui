## Dalbeattie Town History 
The dust from the crusher was blown over the town (and drying washing) in northerly winds. The base of this crusher survives on the corner of the New Station Road junction with Haugh Road. In 1901 the two big Dalbeattie quarries were producing 50,000 tons of crushed granite per year. This grew to 70,000 tons by 1907.

Krishna Sharma: This quarry company came in, purchased the land and basically started downing trees to prepare for that site. And one of the main legal steps that the quarry has to go through is they need to get county-level permission to be able to construct that quarry.
