Grinding/milling can be carried out dry or wet. In wet grinding/milling smaller particle sizes can be attained. Often dry grinding (milling) is combined with sieving or air classification, this results in particle size fractions. Generally cyclones are used as an integral part of the process to recover the particulate matter (dust) in extracted
