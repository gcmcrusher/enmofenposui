Gypsum grinding process The crushed gypsum is sent to a ball mill for grinding until 90% of it is less than 149 μm (100 mesh). The ground gypsum powder leaves the mill in the form of airflow and is collected in the cyclone separator. The process of grinding Ball mill The ball mill is mainly a machine for dry or wet grinding of the crushed gypsum.

Introduction. Gypsum is monoclinic mineral, and its main chemical component is calcium sulfate (CaSO4). Natural dihydrate gypsum (CaSO42H2O) is also known as raw gypsum, after calcination, grinding can be obtained Beta-type hemihydrate gypsum (CaSO41/2H2O), that is, building gypsum, also known as plaster, plaster.
