06.06.2003[35] The crushed dolomite particle size was smaller than that used all of the previous experiments (i.e., 177–210 μm, instead of 250–350 μm), in order to increase the reaction surface. As a result, the distance between bands (∼12 cm), and their width (∼5.5 cm), are different than those shown in Figure 6 (∼8 cm and ∼4 cm, respectively) for the larger columns.
