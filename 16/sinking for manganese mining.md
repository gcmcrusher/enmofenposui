Manganese nodules are authigenic deposits composed principally of manganese oxides enriched in Fe and Co, Ni, and Cu. They occur in all the world's oceans but are generally found in areas where sediment accumulation rate is slow. Indeed, Mn nodules grow slowly—millimeters to 10s of millimeters per million years.

## A historical perspective on deep
01.07.2019In 1965, the American mining engineer John L. Mero published the book "The Mineral Resources of the Sea" that brought the idea of manganese nodules as a resource to a broader scientific readership ( Mero, 1965 ). This book is often said to have marked the starting point for a multitude of deep-sea mining projects worldwide.

01.07.2019Of late, there has been a rise in interest in deep-sea minerals such as manganese nodules. Commercial mining operations to extract such minerals may commence soon. However, deep-sea mining projects were already underway in the 1960s and in an advanced stage of development by the 1970s, only to be shelved again in the 1980s.
