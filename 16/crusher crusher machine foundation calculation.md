## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency 
13.05.2019Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of a machine's work to the energy supplied to the machine. To apply what this means to your crusher, operations produce the exact sizes in the reduction process that their market demands. In the past, quarries produced a range of single-size aggregate products â€“ up to 40 mm in size.

## PQ University Lesson 7
02.09.2019In the quarry, crushing is handled in four potential stages: primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. The reduction of aggregate is spread over these stages to better control the product size and quality, while minimizing waste. The primary stage was once viewed merely as a means to further reduce stone following the blast or excavation
