## How Wind Energy Works: Learn How Wind Power Works
Oct 12, 2016The kinetic energy from the spinning blades, caused by the wind, turns the central drive shaft. In the presence of wind, a small area of low-pressure air forms on the downward side of the turbine blade. This low-pressure region draws the blade toward it, providing lift that exceeds the wind's drag against the front of the blade.

## How much wind for a wind turbine 
The amount of power generated by a wind turbine is proportional to the cube of the wind speed. This means that increasing the average wind speed from 6 m/s to 7 m/s results in 60% more power from the same turbine and an increase in annual energy production of 36%. This is why it is so important to get wind turbines sited in optimal locations

## Characteristics of a good wind power site 
Good grid connection. All of the wind turbines that we supply require a suitable three-phase electrical supply to connect to. As a rough guide you will need an 11 kV transformer or substation that is roughly double the rated power output of the wind turbine you are considering, or an 11 kV three-phase power line passing close to the wind turbine site that can have a new transformer

## Wind farm 
Wind farm | Enel Green Power. A wind farm is a site designated to be used for wind power generation. It's made up of a group of wind generators ranging from 600 kW to 5 MW spread across the land in order to take maximum advantage of the wind. There are three types of wind farms. On-shore (at least 3 km inland from the coast) is the most

1.1 The UK began to focus on the benefits of wind energy in the early 1990s as global concern about climate change influenced energy policy. Land-based wind energy has become the lead renewable technology during the last decade. However, after a promising start, industry argues that wind energy development has been slow over the last 5 years.

## How does wind energy work? 
Wind can be used to generate electricity through harnessing its kinetic energy. This means that the motion of the turning blades on the wind turbine - which is created as wind passes over them - creates an energy that can then be converted into electricity. Wind turbines typically have two or three propeller-like blades that are designed to

## How long does a wind turbine last? 
How long does a wind turbine last? The design life of a good quality modern wind turbine is 20 years. Depending on how windy and turbulent the site is, the turbine could last for 25 years or even longer, though as with anything mechanical, the maintenance costs will increase as it gets older. It is unlikely that a wind turbine would last longer
