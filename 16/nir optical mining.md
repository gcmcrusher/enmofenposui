## Quartz glass and fused silica for NIR Applications 
Optical Materials for NIR Applications. For IR applications in the wavelength range from 780 - 3600 absorption can play a major role. Absorption is the root cause of thermal lensing. The optimal performance depends on the absorption value of the specific fused silica grade. Metallic impurities and OH molecules are sources of absorption.
