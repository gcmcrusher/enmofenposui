## 12 Uses of Rocks 
Rocks are a natural solid substance. From building to highways- we can find the rocks almost everywhere. The robustness of rocks has played a significant role in everyday life. All the major uses of rocks are discussed here. Rock, in geology, is naturally occurring and coherent aggregate of one or more minerals.

## What is the difference between a rock and a mineral?
A mineral is a naturally occurring inorganic element or compound having an orderly internal structure and characteristic chemical composition, crystal form, and physical properties. Common minerals include quartz, feldspar, mica, amphibole, olivine, and calcite. A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals, or a body of undifferentiated mineral matter.

## What is Rock, Types of Rocks and Classification 
Rock is a solid mineral substance on the surface or under the soil, forming part of the earth surface. The outer layer of the world forms rocks. In geological definition, rocks are formed by the combination of one or more minerals. For example, granite consists of quartz, feldspar and biotite minerals.We all know that the rock is right.

## Geology Rocks 
The ground under our feet is made of many different kinds of rock. In some places we can see the rocks, but often they are buried under soil, roads or buildings. If we dig into the ground we will always find rock, as we do in quarries and mines. Rocks are made of minerals, which are solid chemical elements or compounds that occur naturally.
