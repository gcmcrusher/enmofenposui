## What does a commutator do in DC machines? 
The centre one is for a single coil commutated motor. In real DC motors there are multiple coils. The coils are arranged such that the torque curves look like the right hand graph above, a three coil motor. The commutator then supplies current to the appropriate coil at the appropriate angle to keep the torque close to the peak of those curves.

## Commutator Undercutting 
Commutator undercutting is performed to undercut the mica separating the copper segments so that the carbon brushes will wear evenly. Mica is hard and does not wear down evenly with the copper segments. Over the lifetime of a DC motor, the commutator will be undercut as part of a prevent maintenance program to eliminate arcing and extend the brush life.

Applications. Commutators are used in: electric motors. electrical generators. direct current (DC) rotating machines. In motors, commutators apply power to the best location on the rotor. A steady, rotating force (torque) is produced by reversing the current direction in the moving coil of the motor's armature.
