## Horsepower Calculator
Horsepower. Horsepower is a unit of measurement of power developed by engineer James Watt in the late 18 th century. Although its original purpose was to compare the output of steam engines with the power of horses (hence its name), it has since been adopted as a unit of measurement for all sorts of engines used to power things such as vehicles, lawn mowers,

## Chain Speed Calculations
Formula for Chain Speed Calculation. Take chain pitch and multiply x two. Multiply above number by number of teeth on sprocket of saw. Multiply that number by saw RPM. The number you get will be chain speed in inches per minute. To convert to feet divide by 12. To convert to feet per second divide by 720. Example: 3/8 chain, with 7 tooth sprocket.
