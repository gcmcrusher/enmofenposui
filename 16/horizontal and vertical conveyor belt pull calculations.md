Compared to typical belt conveyors tube conveyors have very small curve radii, and this tube shape allows the conveyor to curve horizontally as well as vertically. This very flexible conveyor routing often means that a single tube conveyor can replace several conventional belt conveyors, reducing: The requirement for multiple transfer points and drives that require more
