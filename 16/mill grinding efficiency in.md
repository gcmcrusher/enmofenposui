## Addition of pebbles to a ball
Ball-mills are used widely for secondary grinding. Loveday (2010) reported on laboratory tests in which small pebbles (7-25 mm) were used in various proportions with balls. The optimum proportion of pebbles, by volume, was found to be about 25%. Substantial savings in power and ball consumption were achieved, with no loss in grinding capacity.
