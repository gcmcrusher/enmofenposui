Demand for cement in the construction industry drives production and is thus an important determinant of cement subsector energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. Initial estimates suggest that 4.3 Gt of cement were produced globally in 2020. This is a modest increase from 4.2 Gt the previous year, driven in large part by infrastructure-related stimulus projects in China.
