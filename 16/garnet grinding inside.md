## Basic Principles of Abrasive Blasting 
Hardening or shot-peening of a surface by abrasive blasting is a specialized field that has become essential to the life of high stress components. In effect, shot-peening stretches and compresses the surface. Increased fatigue strength of metal is achieved by bombarding the surface with a high-velocity stream of pre-selected round balls.

## Star Ruby Gemstone Information 
Nov 08, 2018Star ruby is a rare variety of ruby that exhibits asterism; a six-rayed star that shimmers over the surface of the stone when it is moved. The star effect is owed to aligned needle-like rutile inclusions. It is the rutile which is responsible for its silky shine. In rough form, ruby is dull and greasy, but when cut and polished its luster is comparable to fine diamond.
