## Choosing the right conveyor belt for food safety 
15.06.2021Bacteria can harbour on and in conveyor frames, under equipment, under the belt, or even in the small gaps of a plastic modular belt. What's more, they can elude even the most rigorous cleaning cycles, leading to excessive use of detergent, water, time and energy. So, evidently, food safety goes to the heart of the food process and supply chain.
