## Manganese in plants and soil 
Manganese is available in soil pH lower than 7.0. At soil pH lower than 5.5, manganese toxicity might occur. At a higher soil pH, low-solubility manganese compounds form and manganese solubility is reduced. Furthermore, at high soil pH, a higher rate of manganese adsorbs to soil particles and, as a result, its availability to plants decreases.
