## Studies on Quarry Dust as Partial Replacement of Fine
In this experimental investigation, an attempt has been made to use Quarry dust to replace the fine aggregates in concrete. Following are some of the conclusions drawn from the results of this investigation: 1. Quarry dust can be used as a finer material which can reduce the voids in concrete. 2. Up to 20% replacement of fine aggregates by quarry
