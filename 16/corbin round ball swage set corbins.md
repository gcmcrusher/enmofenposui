## A couple of questions about bullet swaging and brass drawing
Hello everyone! I have a rifle in 14.5mm x 114 that i dont shoot because the ammo/components are not available. I'd like to change that, thats why im here :) Im know very little about bullet swaging. I tried to go through the info on the Corbin's site, but the site is poorly organized and confusing (to me at least) First question is pretty straight forward.

## What is the deal with the 45
12.10.2005I once thought I'd never ever cast a bullet. That didn't work. I cast cores for my swage and I cast bullets directly for my rifles. I still swage though and they are ungoddly perfect bullets. But that won't win you a match by itself. If you are thinking about swaging - I would recommend that you look at BOTH Corbin swaging companies.
