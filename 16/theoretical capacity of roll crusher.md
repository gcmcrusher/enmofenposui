During the process of crushing, the crushing clearance of rolls is set to 0.6 to 2.4 times 80% passing size of feed material, and feed rate is limited so that passing rate of the material ranges 0.5 to 0.8 times the theoretical throughput capacity of the crusher, which remarkably increases the actual throughput of the roll crusher.
