## Ball Mill 
Ball mills give a controlled final grind and produce flotation feed of a uniform size. Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is

09.04.2015The material can pass through to the proceeding section, but the balls cannot. This ensures that the smaller particles are attacked by the smaller grinding media. Ball mill is a versatile grinding mill and has a wide range of applications. The mill can vary in size from small batch mills up to mills with outputs of hundreds of tons per hour.

The shape of crushed ore affects the product particle size in a ball mill grinding circuit. It has also been proposed that green pellet quality is directly related to the amount of fine particles in a pelletizing plant (Dwarapudi et al., 2008; Umadevi et al., 2008; Gul et al, 2014; Van der Meer, 2015).
