## Paint 
Paint is any pigmented liquid, liquefiable, or solid mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture. Paint can be made in many colors—and in many different types. Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid.

## Tips for Finishing Cherry 
The technique is simple. First, apply a thin coat of shellac (Step 1). Sand it lightly, apply the colored glaze (thinned burnt umber artists' oil color—more on this later) and wipe it off. That's it. Because the shellac has sealed the wood, the color goes on evenly, without making the surface look muddy.

## Finish Your Swimming Pool 
CHOOSE A WATER COLOR. You may not know that there only two primary water colors for your swimming pool, blue and green. The shade of blue and green are determined by a variety of factors. The single greatest water color determiner is the background dye in the finish. For blue water look for a finish that is white, blue, black, or gray.
