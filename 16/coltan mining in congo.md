## Coltan 
Coltan smuggling likely provides income for the military occupation of Congo, as well as prolonged civil conflict. To many, this raises ethical questions akin to those of blood diamonds. Owing to the difficulty of distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate mining operations, several processors such as Cabot Corp (USA) have decided to forgo central African coltan altogether,

## Mining and illicit trading of coltan in the Democratic Republic of Congo
Mining and the illicit trade in minerals have long been the source of social and environmental upheaval in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and coltan, a mineral essential to modern electronics, has become a particular focus of criminal networks. This study reveals a network of organised crime involved in the production and supply chain

## Coltan
Coltan is mined through a fairly primitive process similar to how gold was mined in California during the 1800s.Coltan mining is very well paid in Congo terms. The average Congolese worker makes $10 a month, while a coltan miner can make anywhere from $10 to $50 a week.
