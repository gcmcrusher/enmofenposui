steel ("blanks"). Similar to the sulphide ore refining process, an electrical charge is applied to the liquid, causing the copper to attach to the sheets. Over approximately 10 days, the starter sheets fatten to a width of 2.5 centimetres, forming 99.9 percent copper cathodes. This process is known as "electro winning".

## Copper slag – Sand International
Copper slag. Copper slag is a by-product of copper extraction by smelting. During smelting, impurities become slag which floats on the molten metal. Slag that is quenched in water produces angular granules which are disposed of as waste or utilized. Copper Purity ranges from 3-15%.

## TENORM: Copper Mining and Production Wastes 
01.08.2022Ores that contain copper in the U.S. are typically mined in large, open-pits. Copper processing facilities are usually located near mining or extraction sites. Significant waste volumes are associated with copper production. Mine wastes may contain radionuclides due to their natural presence in ores and can be a source of TENORM.

The copper ore treatment process in RTB Bor produces significant amounts of mine waste material such as: mining waste, flotation tailing and copper slag (Stanojlovic et al., 2014). Mine waste can be defined as waste materials that result from the ore exploration, mineral and pyrometallurgical processing.

5.1 Process Overview 5.1.1 Copper Ore Mining Copper is commonly extracted from surface, underground and increasingly, from in situ operations. In 2000, the principal mining States, in descending order, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and Montana, accounted for 99 percent of domestic production. Copper was also recovered at mines in three other States.

23.08.2019Copper ore processing. According to the metallurgy process, the copper ore is divided into three natural types by the ratio of copper oxide and copper sulfide. That is, sulfide ore, containing less than 10% copper oxide; oxidized ore, containing more than 30% copper oxide; mixed ore, containing 10% to 30% of copper oxide.
