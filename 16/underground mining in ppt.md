## Gas Monitoring and Testing in Underground Mines Using Wireless Technology
—Mining is a risky activity, the risk factor Abstract increases exponentially when it comes to underground mine. Working conditions in underground coal mines are much more dangerous than in underground metal mines, as it incorporates the risk of roof fall due to soft strata and the hazardous gases

## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
While underground mining, which allows coal companies to extract deeper deposits of coal, is viewed as less destructive than strip mining, the effects of mining widespread damage to the environment. In room-and-pillar mines, columns of coal are left to support the ground above during the initial mining process, then they are often taken out and the mine is left to collapse,

16.03.2017Shrinkage stoping refers to any overhand method in which the stope is kept full of broken ore until it is completed. The miners stand on top of the broken ore and work at the back. As broken ore takes up more space than ore in a solid mass, about 35 to 40 per cent, of it must be drawn to leave room for working.

Caving is referred to the controlled fragmentation of rocks due to the flow gravity, whereas the term stoping is the excavation of a stable opening of small or large di mensions. Underground mining methods are categorized by the following methods: room and pillar, stop-and-pi llar,

## The Advances of Technology Methods of Future Mining Operations
02.02.2018Continued advances in mining technology have the potential to reduce the extraction period of a mine nearly in half. A mine given a 30 year lifespan, with the adaption to new mining technologies, could see the mine's lifespan decreased to 15 to 20 years. This makes investing millions of dollars into permanent infrastructure not as

## Types of Underground Mining Method Comparison
16.03.2017In any discussion of Methods of Underground Mining Comparison, one is repeatedly confronted with the difficulty of dealing with so many variable conditions. It is not an exact science and in the choice of a method each varying factor has a certain weight, which, in many cases, experience alone can determine. In mathematical terms, it is a function of many

## Mining 
20.05.2022Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with

## Longwall Mining Overview 
LONGWALL MINING Overview. In the method of secondary extraction known as longwall mining a relatively long mining face (typically in the range 100 to 300m but may be longer) is created by driving a roadway at right angles between two roadways that form the sides of the longwall block, with one rib of this new roadway forming the longwall face.
