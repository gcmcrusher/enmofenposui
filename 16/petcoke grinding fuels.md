## Petroleum Coke 
Like Sulfur, Petroleum coke ("petcoke") is a by-product of crude oil refining. The coking processes produce "green coke" which is then further processed into two main products, calcined petcoke and fuel grade petcoke. Petcoke quality varies by refinery, depending on crude quality and coking technology, with such variables as sulfur
