## Section A FUNDAMENTALS OF COMMODITIES
Initial processing for most metals generally takes place at or near the mine to reduce transportation costs. Iron ore is left untreated, but mined copper, lead, nickel and zinc ores are turned into concentrates, while bauxite is turned into alumina. Iron ore, concentrates and alumina are traded as primary commodities.

## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, Extraction Methods
27.09.2021The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke. Coke is cheap and

## DRI production 
DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state, i.e. without melting, as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen, coming from reformed natural gas, syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

Processing The crushed iron ore is then processed above ground to either fines or iron ore pellets. It is a complex process that takes place in several stages: Sorting: The ore is roughly sorted and residual waste rock removed. After that, the iore ore is crushed into smaller fractions. This increases the iron concentration from approximately 45 to more than 60 percent.

Aug 10, 2022This work proposes a novel horizontal high-shear granulator for iron ore granulation before sintering process. The granulation behavior such as growth process and structure of granules were firstly analyzed, followed by the effects of operation conditions such as water content, initial particle size distribution, and the concentrate ratio. The results show that

## Iron Ore 
31.12.2018Download [PDF 1.2 MB] Iron (Fe) is a metallic element that constitutes 5.6% by weight of the Earth's crust and is the fourth most abundant element in the crust. Iron ores are rocks from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The principal iron ores contain hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ).
