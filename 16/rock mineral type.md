29.03.2022Iron Ore. They are rocks and minerals that are commercially mined for metallic iron. Iron oxides in the ores in multitude, which range in color from dark grey to brilliant yellow to deep purple to rusty red. Magnetite, hematite, goethite, limonite, and siderite are all examples of iron minerals. "Natural ore" or "straight shipping ore

## Mineral 
A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals or mineraloids. Some rocks, such as limestone or quartzite, are composed primarily of one mineral – calcite or aragonite in the case of limestone, and quartz in the latter case. Other rocks

## Types of minerals 
Identifying common minerals can usually be accomplished by examining a hand specimen. Minerals have distinct physical properties such as specific gravity, streak, and form which can easily distinguish the major rock-forming minerals. More detailed examination of minerals can be undertaken by examining a microscope thin section of a rock or mineral.
