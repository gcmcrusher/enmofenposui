Mar 04, 2019Modern CPUs can have thousands of pins, with the high-end AMD Threadripper having 4094 of them. Since the CPU produces a lot of heat, and should also be protected from the front, an "integrated heat spreader" is mounted to the top. This makes contact with the die and transfers heat to a cooler that is mounted on top.
