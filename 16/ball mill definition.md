## What's the Difference Between SAG Mill and Ball Mill
The biggest characteristic of the sag mill is that the crushing ratio is large. The particle size of the materials to be ground is 300 ~ 400mm, sometimes even larger, and the minimum particle size of the materials to be discharged can reach 0.1 mm. The calculation shows that the crushing ratio can reach 3000 ~ 4000, while the ball mill's

The ball milling process is generally divided into two types, the dry ball milling process, and the wet ball milling process. This article takes dry ball milling as an example to introduce the ball milling process. First, select the appropriate size and weight of the grinding medium according to the particle size of the grinding material.

## SIZE REDUCTION 
At low speeds, the ball roll over each other and attrition (rubbing action) will be the predominate mode of action. Thus, in the ball mill, impact or attrition or both are responsible for the size reduction. Advantages: It can produce very fine powder. Ball mill is used for both wet and dry grinding processes.

## The working principle of ball mill 
The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force. At a certain height, it will automatically fall and impact
