Most often, hot air from the clinker cooler, so-called tertiary air, is utilized as combustion air (Fig. 2-4f). The consumption of fuel for calcination can account for up to 60% of fuel needed for cement production. The degree of decarbonisation constitutes 90-95% and solid material enters the rotary kiln with a temperature of about 900 oC.
