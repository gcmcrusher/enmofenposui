## Compaction properties of different soils and suitable solutions
The compaction properties of gravel and sand are influenced by the water content; compaction is most effective when there is ideal water content. If the fine content is less than 5 to 10%, the soil is considered free draining. In free-draining soils, excess water is drained off during compaction. This means that, in certain circumstances, the

17.10.2016Layer thickness of the quarry dust. In most practical situations, quarry dust has to be placed in several layers according to the excavation depth, level of ground water table, required bearing capacity, etc. Therefore, the layer thickness used in such situations is believed to play a major role in compaction.

## Introduction to Quarry
19.05.2020Quarry dust is a waste from the crushing unit which accounts 25%-30% of the final product from stone crushing unit and a reason to cause environmental pollution. Quarry dust can be used as an admixture in concrete efficiently to lessen its impact on environment and human. It can also be used as partial replacement of cement in concrete. Cement can be replaced
