## Mixing bowl review 2022 
17.12.2020Best budget mixing bowl. Key features: stainless steel; 23cm; dishwasher-, oven- and freezer-proof. Small and lightweight, this is a bowl that will earn its keep many times over. It will take up little of your precious cupboard space, and goes in the dishwasher, oven (up to 240C) and freezer. It has a relatively big base, so is stable when mixing.

## Grinding 
Grinding is a significant and critical part of the ore winning process. On average, milling is the process that requires the most energy in the whole mining operation.
