Studies have found that for most types of cement, water-reducing agents can improve the workability of concrete. However, one of the important issues in using superplasticizers in concrete is slump loss. Superplasticizer effect lasts only 30 Dao 60 minutes, and it depends on the brand and dose rate, followed by a rapid loss of performance.

Fluid loss additives Fluid loss additives are also called filtrate-reducing agents.Fluid losses may occur when the fluid comes in contact with a porous formation. This is relevant for drilling and completion fluids, fracturing fluids, and cement slurries. The extent of fluid loss is dependent on the porosity and thus the permeability of the formation and may reach approximately 10 t/hr.

## Environmentally Acceptable Cement Fluid Loss Additive
20.03.2002The selection of a fluid loss additive is important for cement placement and zonal isolation. Fluid loss additives help prevent water loss from the slurry, and thus, help prevent cement bridging in the annulus. Restricting fluid loss also protects water-sensitive formations. Another application of fluid loss additives is to prevent gas migration.
