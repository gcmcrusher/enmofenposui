## What Is Cement Made Of? 
The active ingredient that makes all those things possible is cement. Cement is a very unique material because it chemically reacts with water to form a paste that crystallizes and becomes extremely hard and strong. The raw mix is about 70% limestone and 30% clay. It's then moved to a raw mill bin for further grinding.
