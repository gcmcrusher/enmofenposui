Base-load operation: Much like nuclear power, coal-fired thermal power is generated around-the-clock and the output is constant. It cannot be adjusted to respond to power demand fluctuations. LNG-fired thermal power: Base-to-middle-load operation: These sources of power can be made to respond flexibly to daily fluctuations in electric power demand.

Thermal Power Plant Working | INDIAN POWER . A coal based thermal power plant converts the chemical energy of the coal into electrical energy. This is achieved by raising the steam in the boilers, expanding it through the turbine and coupling the turbines to the generators which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

## thermal power plant working principle pdf
Geothermal Power Plant Working Principle. Normally the thermal energy available inside the earth is at a depth of more than 80 km. The average temperature gradient in the earth's surface is 30 o C /km depth. Therefore, for power generation to attain temperatures up to 300 o C, a hole has to be drilled in earth's surface of about 10 km depth.
