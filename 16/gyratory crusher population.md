## Chamber Optimization for Comprehensive Improvement of Cone Crusher 
15.03.2021This is due to the decrease of the effective crushing times in the crushing chamber when the bottom angle of the mantle increases. As shown in Figures 5 (a) and 5 (b), crusher productivity is decreased from 998 t/h to 850 t/h at the rate of 15%,, as the length of the parallel zone increases from 140 mm to 190 mm.
