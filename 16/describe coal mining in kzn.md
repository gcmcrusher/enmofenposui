They are two most basic methods that miners use to quarry coal. While surface mining is used for coal that can be found anywhere from the surface to 200 feet below, underground mining is used for coal that is located lower. In surface mining, the top layer is removed which may include plants, soil rocks. This exposes the coal below the top layer.
