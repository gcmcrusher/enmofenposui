## Cube Test and its Procedure 
After 7 or 28 days of curing, the specimen is tested by the compression testing machine. A load of 140 kg/cm2 per minute is gradually applied until the specimen fails. So we get the compressive strength of concrete, by the load at the failure divided by the area of the specimen.

## Concrete test cube manufacturing and curing procedures
The cube strength of concrete is specifi ed by a structural engineer and is assessed by crushing concrete cubes at a specifi ed age (28 days after casting). Early strength may also be assessed at 3 or 7 days after casting. The preparation, handling, curing and testing of concrete cubes are done according to SANS 5861-3: 2006 Concrete Tests

Jan 29, 2017Definition. Compressive strength of concrete is the Strength of hardened concrete measured by the compression test. The compression strength of concrete is a measure of the concrete's ability to resist loads which tend to compress it. It is measured by crushing cylindrical concrete specimens in compression testing machine. The compressive

## A Simple Guide to Concrete Cube Testing 
Cube Testing The cubes are generally tested at 7 28 days unless specific early tests are required, for example to remove a concrete shutter safely prior to 7 days. Usually 1 cube will be tested at 7 days and 2 cubes at 28 days, however this may vary depending of the requirements, check the design first.
