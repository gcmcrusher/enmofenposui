## General Processing Technology For Minerals 
Flotation is a typical mineral ore processing method based on the difference of the physical and chemical property and floatability between valuable minerals and veins. Technically, flotation can be used in almost all of the mineral separation. It is especially efficient to process metal and non-metal minerals like copper, pyrite, iron, gold

## Reverse Flotation 
Compared with the SLon magnetic separator, the operating cost of reverse flotation is much higher. The flow sheet in Figure 9.16 provides an example of how to minimize the feed to flotation to reduce the total production cost. The iron ore is composed dominantly of specularite with only about 0.5% magnetite, and the gangue mineral is mainly quartz.

The tailings produced by iron ore flotation are treated by the wet high-intensity magnetic separation for iron scavenging. The magnetic separator is operated with air-gap field strength of 2-100, and preferably 5-10 kg. Magnetic concentrate from scavenging is reprocessed by flotation to improve iron recovery.

## Iron Ore Processing 
Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.

## Magnetic Ore 
This ancient Indian method of steelmaking, with the most likely origin in Tamil Nadu, was described in great detail by Richard Burton in The Book of the Sword:. About a pound weight of malleable iron, made from magnetic ore, is placed, minutely broken and moistened, in a crucible of refractory clay, together with finely chopped pieces of wood Cassia auriculata.

## Effect of reverse flotation on magnetic separation concentrates
Aug 09, 2012Further milling of the ore to 25 μm resulted in a higher magnetic-rich product after magnetic separation. Reverse flotation tests were conducted on the agitated magnetic concentrate feed, and the result shows a significant upgrade of Fe compared to that obtained from the non-agitated feed. Iron concentrations greater than 69%, and SiO 2
