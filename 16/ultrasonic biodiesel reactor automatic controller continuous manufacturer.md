## A critical review of recent advancements in continuous flow reactors 
Continuous reactors have various advantages in biodiesel yield. Among continuous reactors, microreactors are more efficient due to their high surface volume ratios and greater mass and heat transfer rates. The microreactors mixing unit plays a significant role in the yield and creates an impact on parameters affecting biodiesel yield.
