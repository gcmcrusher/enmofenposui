## In
In the thermal power plants maximum requirements of fuel is a coal. The handling of this fuel is a great job. To handle the fuel i.e. coal, each power station is equipped with a coal handling plant. Maintenance of Critical Equipments for Coal Handling Plants (CHP) of Thermal Power Stations is typical job. The failures of these equipments have

## Thermal Power Plant – Basic, Definition, Parts, Working Principle
A thermal power plant is one kind of plant or system, which is used to produce electrical power by using thermal energy. Fig. 1 Thermal power plant. Coal is mainly used as fuel. Normally brown, bituminous, and peat coals are widely used. Water is used as secondary fuel which helps to transfer thermal energy from coal.
