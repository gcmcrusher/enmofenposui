Increasing product titres from mammalian cell culture has resulted in a trend to identify ways of improving the economics of product recovery and purification processes. In commercial manufacturing, a requirement exists to increase the scale of the chromatography operations, which are typically developed and optimised in small-scale experiments.

## gold recovery processes 
Nitric process or CN process can be used to remove gold from gold plated/polished pins and connectors. From CPUs we can recover gold through aqua regia. Pyrolysis and hydrometallurgy are used for gold recovery from computer chips. Our methods of gold recovery from computer parts are 100% safe and environment friendly.
