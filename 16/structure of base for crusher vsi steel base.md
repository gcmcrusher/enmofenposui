## What Type of Crusher Is Best for Different Crushing Process?
24.12.2021Traditionally, impact crushers are divided into two main types, horizontal axis impact (HSI) crushers and vertical axis impact (VSI) crushers. These different types of impact crushers have the same crushing principle, that is, impact crushers can reduce materials to smaller sizes, but their characteristics, capacities and best applications are far from each other.

Step 1: Clear the Area. Before you can build a gazebo on your property, you'll need to establish a clear, preferably level area. To be fit for a foundation, the site must not have debris, grass, roots, and rocks. You must also fill any holes with compacted soil to make the ground level.

Figure 8.1 shows two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher, an eccentric shaft is installed on the top of the crusher. Shaft rotation causes, along with the toggle plate, a compressive action of the moving jaw. A double toggle crusher has, basically, two shafts and two toggle plates. The first shaft is a pivoting shaft on
