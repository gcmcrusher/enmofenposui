## Ubiquitous Mining: The Spatial Patterns of Limestone Quarrying 
The limestone quarries that I will focus on in this essay developed in the context of the demand from the iron industry in an area just south of the Ruhr between the cities of Essen, Dsseldorf, and present-day Wuppertal in the district of Mettmann. Large-scale limestone quarrying in the district started in the 1850s in the Neanderthal valley.

Opencast mining is also known as open-put mining, open-cut mining, surface mining and also as strip mining, the later term being commonly used in the U.S.A. for opencast mining of coal. The overburden and the mineral, coal, are excavated in long strips of a few metres thickness and hence the operations are termed strip mining.

## Opencast Mining (Quarrying): Methods, Advantages Disadvantages 
Opencast mining or quarrying of minerals is easier than mining by underground methods. During quarrying the alluvium and rocks below which the minerals lie, are removed and dumped, in the initial stages, in a place which is not required in future for quarrying, residential or other purposes. The mineral exposed is completely extracted.
