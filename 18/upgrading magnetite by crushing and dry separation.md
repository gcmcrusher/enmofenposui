## Dry Drum Magnetic Separators 
Ideal for rougher or primary beneficiation applications, our dry drum magnetic separators recover highly magnetic material through its permanent magnet designs, while separating non-magnetic material. This reduces the amount of material fed to communition stages, lowering the costs of crushing and milling. Dry drum magnetic separators also act as an initial gangue

The concentrate from first magnetic separation will go for milling again and then magnetic separation for the second separation. The magnetite after crushing can be rough separated by magnetic pulley to remove the gangue or surrounding rock. The weak magnetic hematite iron can be upgraded by weak magnetic separator after roasting of rotary kiln.
