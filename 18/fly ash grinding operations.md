In the production of fly ash, coal is first pulverized in grinding mills before being blown with air into the burning zone of the boiler. In this zone the coal combusts producing heat with tempertures reaching approximately 1500C (2700F). At this temperature the non-combustible inorganic minerals (such as quartz, calcite,

## Influence of Size Reduction of Fly Ash Particles by Grinding 
Abstract: Chemical properties of geopolymers were evaluated from the reduction of fly ash particle size by grinding. X-ray diffraction determined that at early curing ages new crystalline phases appear in the matrix of the geopolymer and they remain for 28 days, with increases in intensities up to 60%.

## The Effect of Fly Ash and Recycled Aggregate on the Strength 
Apr 13, 2020The research results indicate that ECC with fly ash tends to reduce the crack width and improve the robustness of the tensile ductility, and also reduces the free drying shrinkage while slightly reducing the compressive strength after 28 days. The effects of various concrete recycling operations on CO 2 emissions were studied and showed
