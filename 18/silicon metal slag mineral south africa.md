## ANALYSIS OF SLAG CONTENT IN FERRO ALLOYS PART I 
02.07.2012PART I – FERRO MANGANESE. Slag is a partially vitreous byproduct of metal smelting to separate the metal fraction from the unwanted fraction. Ores often have unwanted minerals associated with them, like silica, and during the process of smelting this can combine with other materials in the furnace and the fuel to produce something that looks a lot like lava.
