Step 2: Get the weight-based truck emissions factor for a freight truck. The average freight truck in the U.S. emits 161.8 grams of CO2 per ton-mile. Step 3: Multiply this emissions factor with the total ton-miles

## How to Use the QUERY Function in Google Sheets 
08.01.2020The format of a formula that uses the QUERY function is =QUERY (data, query, headers). You replace "data" with your cell range (for example, "A2:D12" or "A:D"), and "query" with your search query. The optional "headers" argument sets the number of header rows to include at the top of your data range. If you have a header

Feb 10, 2014Quarry professionals are advised to divide the weight per square metre by 80 to get an estimate of stemming equivalence, ie at 60 kg/m2, the stemming equivalence is 60/80, or 750mm. A quick look at Figure 3 shows that an increase in stemming from 3.25m to 4.0m will halve the recommended clearance zone from 200m to 100m.

Nov 07, 2021A conventional track conveyor would use the same formula as above if using an AC motor to drive the track. If using a servo-driven belt conveyor, the speed can be calculated within the servo motor's control system.Any servo conveyor will rely heavily on the takt time of the system and the type of material being transported to calculate the speed.
