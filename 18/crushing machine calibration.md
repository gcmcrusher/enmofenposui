Dec 31, 2011 An oven, a concrete cube or cylinder crushing machine etc. can be adjusted and hence need calibration for obvious reasons. Procedure for maintenance and calibration has been briefly discussed below: A unique identification number may be parmanently assigned to each item in a laboratory and the item should be labelled with the number.

## Ring Crush Test Determining the Ring Crush Strength
The ring crush test is similar to the short-span compression test in that the strength of the liner or fluting is measured both in the machine direction and perpendicular to it. It is important that force application to the specimen is exactly perpendicular during these tests. The results of this test are highly dependent on proper specimen
