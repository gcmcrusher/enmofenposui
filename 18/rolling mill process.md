Rolling equipment is roughly divided into three kinds; namely, hot rolling mills, cold rolling mills, and foil mills. Usually, rolling is performed by applying a load to the materials by forcing them vertically through a pair of work rolls. The work rolls are deformed by the high load during the rolling process. Consequently, the shapes of the rolled strips are distorted. In order to

05.06.2020Four-high rolling mills; Tandem rolling mills; Cluster rolling mills; Rolling lubrication: As friction occurs between the rolls and metal during the rolling process, lubrication plays a very important role. The friction is also useful as it is responsible for shifting the work forward between the rolls. That is why it is sometimes eliminated or
