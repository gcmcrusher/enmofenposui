05.11.2015Instagram. 1) Live sand dollars are members of the Phylum Echinodermata, meaning "spiny skin". As the name implies, they have tiny spines all over their bodies that resemble hair.

## Drying meats and sausages
Stuffed sausages that are subject to smoking follow a drying procedure which can last from 0.5-2 hrs at 68-86 F (20-30 C). The time depends on the diameter of the sausage and the amount of moisture it contains. This simple process dries out the surface of the casing so it can acquire smoke better and develop the proper smoking color.
