Cement IndustryIntroductionCement is a rocky powder that can be mixed with water and molded to any desired shape, after which it hardens to a rock-like consistency. It is used worldwide both as a mortar to join bricks and blocks together and as an ingredient of concrete, which is mixture of crushed rock, sand, and cement that is used to construct buildings, bridges, roads, pipes,

12.04.2022The international consortium sets the course for climate-neutral cement production by converting CO 2 into SAF with the use of hydrogen and thus presents an opportunity for CO 2 reduction in both sectors. The SAF production uses a Power to Liquid (PTL) process, which relies on the supply of a sustainable carbon feedstock, such as unavoidable industrial carbon

## Cement Concrete
In its simplest form, concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates. The paste, composed of portland cement and water, coats the surface of the fine and coarse aggregates. Through a chemical reaction called hydration, the paste hardens and gains strength to form the rock-like mass known as concrete. Within this process lies the key to a

27.07.2021The cement production process begins with the aforementioned raw materials being crushed and homogenized into a powder, using specific ratios of each material. The fine powder is pre-heated and calcined, then moved into a large, rotating drum known as a kiln. The kiln is slightly inclined to allow the product to move downwards towards the discharge end.
