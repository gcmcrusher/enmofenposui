Origin of Stone: Granite is formed by extreme heat and pressure underneath the earth's crust. Granite forms a major portion of the continental crust and can be mined in many different countries, including Italy, Brazil, India and the United States (just to name a few locations). If you select a granite mined closer to home, it may cost less.

## Physics of the granite sphere fountain 
(above atmospheric pressure) on this surface must be 1:4 410 N=1:5m2 0:93 104 N=m2 0:1atm. Thus, with the pressure at the rim of the socket (where the water meets the surrounding air) being 1atm, the pressure under the sphere must exceed this on average by 0.1atm. Thus, a sur-prisingly low pressure is required to make the fountain work.

## Is Granite Permeable? (ANSWERED) 
Granite is widely used for construction, which will be detailed much further, later. The average density of granite is between 2.65 and 2.75 g/cubed cm, compressive strength is above 200 MPa (Mega Pascals), and viscosity near STP (standard temperature and pressure) is between 3-6. Granite itself is not soluble in water.
