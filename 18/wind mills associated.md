## Wind Energy in Prince Edward Island
The eight wind farms in the province produce 204 MWs of electricity, about 25 per cent of PEI's electricity supply. Roughly, 21,625 households are powered by electricity produced by the wind. PEI has a total peak electrical load of over 285 Megawatts. See how much of PEI's energy is produced from the wind.

## Wind – Sustainability
Power output of a wind turbine rises as the cube of wind speed. Wind turbines operate within a narrow range of wind speeds – if the wind is too slow, the turbine won't turn, and if it's too fast, the turbine will shed the wind rather than risk damage to the turbine. Wind speeds of over 6.5 meters per second are typically necessary for

## Wind Energy 
Wind Energy. Wind energy is now the lowest-cost source of new electricity generation in Canada. There has been more wind-energy capacity installed in Canada over the last decade than any other form. Wind turbines use the power of the wind to generate electricity. The wind turns the blades of the turbine rotor, which are attached to a driveshaft.

## WINDMILLS HISTORY, DEVELOPMENT, CONTRUCTION AND LINKS TO ASSOCIATED 
A windmill may have existed in what is now Windmill Hill as early as Elizabethan times, when a survey of the Castle estate mentions Wyndmylhyll. In 1769, the windmill was tenanted by one John Edwards, and the mill is on Yeakell and Gardner's map of 1783. In 1814 the old mill was pulled down and an immense post mill with an enormous tailpole

## Wind Farm Design: Planning, Research and Commissioning
02.04.2009After commissioning, the wind farm will be handed over to the operations and maintenance crew. A typical crew will consist of two people for every 20 to 30 turbines in a wind farm. For smaller wind farms there may not be a dedicated OM crew but arrangements will be made for regular visits from a regional team.

## How much do wind turbines cost? 
Wind turbines under 100 kilowatts cost roughly $3,000 to $8,000 per kilowatt of capacity. A 10 kilowatt machine (the size needed to power a large home) might have an installed cost of $50,000-$80,000 (or more). Wind turbines have significant economies of scale. Smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall, but are more expensive
