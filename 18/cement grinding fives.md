## Cement Additives 
Grinding Aids are used in the cement mill (Ball Mill, Vertical Roller Mill, HoroMill) Alkanolamines are frequently used and are able to increase the compressive strength (at different or all age) by max. five MPa. Typical examples are SikaGrind-200 and SikaGrind-700.

## What are the 5 Stages of Cement Hydration Process 
Unless the cement is very finely ground and reground with excess water to regularly expose a fresh surface, it cannot be fully hydrated in a year or more. We can divide the process of hydration of cement into 5 phases, initial mixing reaction. Dormancy. Strength acceleration. Speed Reduction. Steady development.
