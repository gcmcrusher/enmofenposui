## Area and Perimeter 
The concepts of area and perimeter are the basis for understanding Euclidean geometry and calculating the volume of solid shapes in 3-dimensional space such as cones, prism, sphere, and cylinder. Also, we use these formulas for calculating the area and perimeter for quadrilaterals and polygons comprising of sides and curves. The real-life utility of the concept is in several fields

In many games, counter-hits can have special properties. In SFV, some counter-hits, called Crush Counters, can cause massive amounts of hit-stun, launch opponents in the air, or crumple the opponent. In DBFZ: Keep an eye out for special properties on counter-hits. If moves have special properties, they could lead to more damaging combos.

The participant acted as a "teacher," reading out words to the learner. The learner would have to repeat the words back to the participant. If the learner got it wrong, the teacher had to deliver an electric shock.
