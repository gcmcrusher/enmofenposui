## Copper: Mineral information, data and localities. 
Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process, beginning with the mining and concentrating of low-grade ores containing copper sulfide minerals (such as chalcopyrite or chalcocite) and followed by smelting and electrolytic refining to produce a pure copper cathode. An increasing share of copper is produced from acid leaching of oxidized ores.

## The Mineral Copper 
Sulfide ores are more important commercially. Half of the world's copper deposits are in the form of chalcopyrite ore. Ores are removed either by open-pit or by underground mining. Ores containing as little as .15% copper can be mined profitably in open-pit mining, but underground mining is profitable only if an ore contains 6% to 7% copper.
