## Ball mill 
A ball mill, a type of grinder, is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores, chemicals, ceramic raw materials and paints. Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including ceramic balls, flint pebbles

These tools have a tapered profile and rounded cutting edge for making smooth contours on intricate, three-dimensional shapes. They're also known as taper degree end mills. Made of solid carbide, they're harder, stronger, and more wear resistant than high-speed steel for the longest life and best finish on hard material. Their extreme hardness means they are brittle, so a highly
