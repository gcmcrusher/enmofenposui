Jul 20, 2022Too coarse ore particles (greater than 0.1mm) and very fine ore particles (less than 0.006mm) do not float well, and the recovery rate is low.. In the flotation of coarse particles, due to the larger weight, the shedding force of the ore particles increases.So, you need: (1) Use a sufficient amount of the most effective collector.
