9.15.1 Screw Conveyors. Screw conveyors are used to convey bulk material from almost any position (vertical, horizontal, or at an incline) and are one of the most reliable methods of conveyance. The screw conveyor is composed of a pipe with a welded steel strip that is formed into a continuous helix. The helix is referred to as the flighting.

The smallest diameter screw is 0, and the largest commonly available is 24. For bench work, the most useful sizes are 4 through 12. Of those sizes, 6, 8, and 10 are probably used more than any others. There are three basic measurements you are going to take to determine your handlebar dimensions: rise/height, pull back, and width.
