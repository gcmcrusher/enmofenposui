When rebar is placed within a footing, it should be completely encased in concrete by a minimum of 3 inches on all sides. When rebar is allowed to project out of the footings, it is susceptible to more rapid corrosion. Over time, rebar allowed to corrode into the footing can weaken the footing, creating areas subject to cracking.

Dec 18, 2012For example: If the stone you are working with is granite that is approximately .64ft3 your calculation should look like the following; ft3 x lbs/ft3 = lbs so your calculation would be; minimum lbs= .64 x 159 = 101.8, maximum lbs = .64 x 180 = 115.1. Therefore the granite is between 101.8 and 115.1 pounds.
