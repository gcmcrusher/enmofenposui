## Coffee Grinder RPM 
24.01.2020In his talk at the 2015 Barista Camp, Christian Klatt explained that increasing the RPM of the grinder may actually reduce the effect of temperature on grinding. At higher rpm, the coffee passes through the grinder more quickly, so it has less time to absorb heat from the chamber, he explains. The motor will also generate less heat, as it is
