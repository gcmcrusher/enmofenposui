## SELECTION OF MECHANICAL FLOTATION EQUIPMENT 
Mechanical flotation cells can be broken down into two broad categories based on how air is introduced to the cell. In a self aspirated flotation cell air is introduced to the slurry, the vacuum created by the rotorusing . In a forced air flotation cell air is generated external to the cell by a low pressure blower,, and pumped down the

## Flotation 
Froth flotation is an important concentration process. This process can be used to separate any two different particles and operated by the surface chemistry of the particles. In flotation, bubbles are introduced into a pulp and the bubbles rise through the pulp. In the process, hydrophobic particles become bound to the surface of the bubbles.

## Flotation cell manufacturer
Flotation cells and flotation machine made by Fote, the Chinese famous flotation-cell manufacturer, have the following advantages: high air absorption rate and low energy consumption. There are three functions of each tank: air suction, pulp suction and flotation separation. They form the flotation loop on their own without any accessory.
