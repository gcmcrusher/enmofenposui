## Gold mining 
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining

Gold CIL (Carbon in Leach) Process is an efficient design of extracting and recovering gold from its ore. By cyaniding and carbon leaching crushed gold ore slurry simultaneously, the CIL process lowers the gold mining operation cost and increase the gold recovery rate to a degree of 99%. It has become the first choice of modern gold mining and beneficiation plant design.

## How Gold Is Mined 
Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity – known as dor – typically containing between 60-90% gold.

## gold processing 
Refining from scrap. The processing of gold scrap varies not only with the gold content but also with the amenability of the gold in the scrap to extraction. Thus, the bulk of the gold may be recovered by leaching techniques using cyanidation or aqueous chlorination, and the residue may then be treated by smelting to recover the balance.
