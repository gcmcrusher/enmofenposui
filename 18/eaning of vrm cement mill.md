## hardfacing techniques in vrm cement mill
Vertical Roller Mill (VRM) The power used for the actual grinding process while grinding raw materials, depends mainly on the hardness of raw materials and the type of mill used, i.e. ball mill or vertical roller mill. Typically, the motor of the ball mill consumes about 14 15 kWh/ ton of raw mix whereas the VRM.

VRM components are subject to severe wear. This is particularly true when grinding materials with high silica content and slags, such as are found in cement mills. This wear has a direct impact on a plant's bottom line: a worn VRM roller reduces grinding efficiency, increasing the energy demand and costs of milling.

Mills belong to a class of equipments that accomplish comminution of materials in the fine range. There are two types of mills which are mostly used in cement plants for grinding raw mix viz. Ball mills and VRM. Ball mills Ball mills are essentially fine grinding units capable of grinding material to a fineness say 84% passing 90 microns.
