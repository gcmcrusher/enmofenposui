## Bauxite Ore, Minerals in Tilakawadi, Belagavi, Blucrafts 
Bauxite is a soft, whitish to reddish-brown rock. Bauxite Ore is an aluminum ore and is the main source of aluminum. This form of rock consists mostly of the minerals gibbsite Al (OH) 3, boehmite γ-AlO (OH), and diaspore α-AlO (OH), in a mixture with the two iron oxides goethite and hematite, the clay mineral kaolinite, and small amounts of

## Bauxite Ore 
Bauxite Ore is smelted into aluminum Ingots. Bauxite Ore looks like iron ore with beige flecks in it. It can easily be mistaken for iron in low light levels. Bauxite Ore does not smelt into bauxite ingots instead it smelts into aluminum ingots which can be used in many crafting recipes - Spawn Level: around 30, and 11 - Vein size: around 7 - Pick Level: stone or higher. - Rarity:
