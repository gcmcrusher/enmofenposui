Grinding/milling can be carried out dry or wet. In wet grinding/milling smaller particle sizes can be attained. Often dry grinding (milling) is combined with sieving or air classification, this results in particle size fractions. Generally cyclones are used as an integral part of the process to recover the particulate matter (dust) in extracted

## Mill (grinding) 
A mill is a device, often a structure, machine or kitchen appliance, that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding, crushing, or cutting. Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them. Historically mills were powered by hand or by animals (e.g., via a hand crank),

## What is Ball Milling Process 
After rough grinding in the first grinding bin, the material enters the second grinding bin through a single-layer partition board. The bin is inlaid with a flat-lining plate and steel balls, which will further grind the material. The powder is discharged through the discharging grate plate to complete the dry ball milling process.
