01.04.2011Historically, most of Japan's gold was produced from only two mines and by the early 1980s there was virtually no commercial gold production in the country. That changed in 1981 when Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. discovered the highest grade gold ore deposits in the world in what would become the Hishikari Mine.

As of November of 2021, the gold-silver ratio has been fluctuating between 75 and 80. It reached an all-time high of 122 in the outburst of the quarantine in March of 2020.

## Where Is Silver Found? 
Silver can be found all over the world, but is generally concentrated around volcanic and hydrothermal activity. Silver is rarely found in pure form – be it nuggets, lodes or placer deposits – but as alloys, mineral deposits, or in trace amounts of other ores. As such, silver mining is often part of larger operations and is one of many
