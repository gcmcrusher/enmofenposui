## Wet Stone or Whetstone? 
It is a bit old-fashioned now, but the process of sharpening used to be called whetting, so to sharpen a blade was to whet it. Any stone used for sharpening was therefore called a whetstone or whet stone. The terms sharpening stone or honing stone have largely replaced whetstone these days, but you will still hear it used occasionally.
