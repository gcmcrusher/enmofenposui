## Stainless Steel Casting Types and Grades 
May 28, 2018What is Stainless Steel Casting? Stainless steel casting is the special steel casting type used primarily because of their corrosion resistance. All stainless steels casting grades contain a minimum percentage of 10.5% chromium. Chromium is always the deciding factor, although other elements, particularly nickel and molybdenum, are added to improve

## Mercury in natural gas streams: A review of materials and 
15.01.2020During production, mercury may be scavenged by carbon/stainless steel by adsorbing into interfacial surfaces and complexing into the scale/metal grain boundaries. Trace quantities of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), which is very common in natural gas streams, catalyze the reaction of mercury with the iron oxide from the pipes ( Chanvanichskul et al., 2017 ).

## What Is Stainless Steel and How Is It Made? 
Step 1: Melting. Manufacturing stainless steel starts with melting scrap metals and additives in an electric arc furnace (EAF). Using high-power electrodes, the EAF heats the metals over the course of many hours to create a molten, fluid mixture. As stainless steel is 100% recyclable, many stainless orders contain as much as 60% recycled steel.
