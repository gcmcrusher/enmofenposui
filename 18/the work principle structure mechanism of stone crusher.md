Impact crusher working principle. When the stone falls into the working area of the blow bar (hammer), it is crushed by the impact of the blow bar on the high-speed rotating rotor, and is thrown to the apron for a second impact, and rebounds until the rotating blow bar (hammer) is hit again. This process is repeated until the material is

All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.

## Hammer Crusher Working Principle 
We take a Œ¶900 x 900mm single rotor, irreversible multi-row hinged hammer crusher as an example to introduce its structure and parts. This type of hammer crusher is commonly seen in cement plants and is suitable for crushing limestone, coal, and other medium hardness ores. It is mainly composed of a transmission device, rotor, lining plate, grate screen, and shell.
