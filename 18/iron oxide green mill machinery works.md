## Iron Oxide Nanoparticles/Nanopowder and Applications
Iron oxide is the product of a chemical reaction between iron (III) and oxygen. In general, nearly as many as 16 different iron oxides occur naturally with g-Fe2O3 (maghemite), α-Fe2O3 (hematite) and Fe3O4 (magnetite) as the most common ones. Since they are inexpensive and prevalent, iron oxides have extensive applications and emerge as important agents in many

What is mill scale? Mill scale is iron oxide that is formed on a steel surface that has been hot rolled. During hot rolling, due to the high temperature involved, oxide is formed over the entire steel surface. The flaky surface increases as hot rolling progresses. The spots are often hard, but at the same time very fragile.

## Iron Oxide Green For Structure Material Concrete 
Iron is a durable material, but various factors can contribute to, and speed up, decay. Lack of regular maintenance and repairs is often the worst culprit. Corrosion of iron occurs when oxygen and water are present. Over time, the iron returns to the natural oxide forms of the original iron ore it came from.
