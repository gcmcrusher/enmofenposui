As a rule, comminution begins by crushing the ore to below a certain size and finishes by grinding it into powder, the ultimate fineness of which depends on the fineness of dissemination of the desired mineral. In primitive times, crushers were small, hand-operated pestles and mortars, and grinding was done by millstones turned by men, horses, or waterpower. Today,

Selective grinding refers to a kind of grinding phenomenon in which the ore fragmentation degrees is different in the grinding process due to the difference in hardness between minerals. The main purpose of the crushing and grinding operation is not to reduce the ore particle size, but to dissociate the useful minerals from the gangue minerals.
