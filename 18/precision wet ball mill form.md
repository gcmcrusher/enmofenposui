## Size Reduction Equipment 
Size Reduction. Tumbling Steel Ball Mills and Ceramic Lined Mills are one of the most precise, reliable and cost effective methods of fine grinding solids in either a wet or dry state.Ball Mills are referred to by many names including Pebble Mills, Tube Mills and Attrition Mills, but no matter what the nomenclature they all operate on the same efficient principle.

## Bal
Measuring the actual hardness of a precision ball is a complicated and difficult procedure. To make a shop test of hardness, first procure a brand-new, flat, fine toothed, mill bastard file. Hold the ball to be tested in the jaws of a set of clamping pliers like vise grips. If the file glides smoothly over the surface of the ball, it is very hard (60 HRC). If it bites a little when it starts

The Operating Principal. P ulverization takes place in the central chamber of the Micron-Master jet energy mill as the process material is driven at near sonic velocity around the perimeter of the toroidal chamber by multiple jets of air or steam. No grinding media is involved. Size reduction is the result of the high-velocity collisions between particles of the process material itself.
