## Noise control fact sheet 
14.05.2014This page is for: A lot of the noise which you are exposed to at work can be reduced by 'working quiet'. Regular maintenance of plant and using a quiet method for a task can reduce the noise you and your co-workers are exposed to. This fact sheet offers some guiding principles and practical ideas on to how to work quietly.

## Reduce Blasting Noise 
12.02.2020Reduce Blasting Noise. The public relations problems of users of explosives have greatly increased within the past few years. One reason is that explosives and blasting agents are being consumed in increasing quantities. The principal reason, however, is that more people have become physically affected by blasting.

## Acoustic metamaterial capsule for reduction of stage machinery noise 
05.03.2020Sound capsules can be very effective for noise reduction, but also have drawbacks, which limit their applicability to stage machinery. First, sound capsules are often ineffective below 1000 Hz, which is often the most important frequency range, and second, typical sound capsules do not allow air flow, which may lead to overheating of the encapsulated

## New 'quiet dozers' deployed at Hunter mine sites
22.03.2022A fleet of new quieter dozers have been deployed at Yancoal's NSW open cut mines as part of an effort to reduce noise impacts on surrounding communities. Testing of the Cat D10 and Cat D11 machines at the Mount Thorley Warkworth and Moolarben sites have shown they significantly reduce noise emissions externally and for machine operators.
