## Machining Processes: Turning, Milling, and Drilling – Trimantec
We cover three of the most common operations including turning, drilling, and milling. Machining is a very common and versatile manufacturing process. Thus, it's possible to machine various types of material using these three methods. Metals, plastics, composites, and wood are all possible workpiece materials.

## The Cement Manufacturing Process 
20/08/2015Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay, to a fine powder, called raw meal, which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 C in a cement kiln. In this process, the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are

## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.
