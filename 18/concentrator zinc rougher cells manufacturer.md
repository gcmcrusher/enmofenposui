## 28% efficient GaAs concentrator solar cells 
Abstract: AlGaAs/GaAs heteroface solar concentrator cells which exhibit efficiencies in excess of 27% at high solar concentrations (400 suns, AM1.5D, 100 mW/cm/sup 2/) have been fabricated with both n/p and p/n configurations. The best n/p cell achieved an efficiency of 28.1% around 400 suns, and the best p/n cell achieved an efficiency of 27.5% around 1000 suns.

During 2001–02, the concentrator capacity was expanded by 30% to maintain metal-in-concentrate output at 190,000t/y of copper and 600,000oz/y of gold. A pebble crushing circuit and additional grinding capacity were installed.
