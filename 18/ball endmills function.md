Cobalt Steel Ball End Mills with Two Milling Ends. With better heat and wear resistance than high-speed steel, these cobalt steel end mills can run at higher speeds and provide better performance on hard material, such as iron, hardened steel, titanium, and tool steel. When one end wears out, turn the tool around for a sharp edge.

1. End Mills cut rotationally in a horizontal, or lateral (side to side) direction whereas a drill bit only cuts straight down, vertically into the material. 2. Endmills are available in a wide variety of lengths, diameters, flutes and types, and are chosen according to the material they are cutting and the surface finish required for the project.

## End mill 
An end mill is a type of milling cutter, a cutting tool used in industrial milling applications. It is distinguished from the drill bit in its application, geometry, and manufacture. While a drill bit can only cut in the axial direction, most milling bits can cut in the radial direction. Not all mills can cut axially; those designed to cut axially are known as end mills.
