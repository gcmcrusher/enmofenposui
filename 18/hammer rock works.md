## Testing Your Survival Kit – Latter
A rock works as a hammer—good thing! Most areas outdoors have lots of rocks. By using a natural hammer, save pounds in a backpack. Make sure you find a smooth rock as the rough rocks have a tendency to scratch up aluminum tent pegs. Emergency fire starters are not fast fire starters. Building fires takes the right tools and some practice.

## Down the Hole Hammers (DTH) 
The optimum range of hole size for DTH drilling is 90 mm (3.5") to 254 mm (10"). Smaller holes are generally drilled using tophammer drill rigs, and larger holes generally use rotary drill rigs.
