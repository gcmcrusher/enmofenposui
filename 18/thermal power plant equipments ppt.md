## Thermal power station 
The thermal electricity supplied by ENGIE in numerous countries is based on a variety of technologies: Traditional thermal power plants: also called combustion power plants, they operate with energy produced by a steam boiler fueled by coal, natural gas, heating oil, as well as by biomass.The steam activates a turbine which, in turn, drives an alternator to produce

## How are Thermal Power Plants Polluting the Environment?
Thermal pollution is one of the biggest issues on local environments. When the water in a power plant is no longer usable, it often gets discharged into a local waterway. This wastewater generally has a higher temperature than the local natural water, so it can increase the temperature of the water, which in turn can have a negative impact on

## What Is Thermal Power plant?
23.09.2021A thermal power station is a power station in which heat energy is converted to electricity. Typically, water is heated into steam, which is used to drive an electrical generator. After it passes through the turbine the steam is condensed in a steam condenser and recycled to where it was heated. This is known as a Rankine cycle.
