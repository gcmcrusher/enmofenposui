## Biochar application in biofiltration systems to remove nutrients 
For example, in sandy soil amended with 2% (w/w) biochar (feedstock: mesquite; pyrolysis temperature: 400 C), the decrease in biochar size reduced the WHC to almost 50% because grinding the biochar (0.25 mm) resulted in the destruction of intrapores (Z. Liu et al., 2017).

Biochar has been shown to have 6 to 7 times more CEC than humic matter of the same mass. Worms need fine sand-sized particles of grit to grind up the biogenic material they consume in their gizzard-like digestive systems, and they prefer particles of biochar, perhaps because they tend to be coated with bacteria. In a worm's gut, biochar

Feb 04, 2022Charging Biochar. Next I ran the sticks through a wood chipper to grind it up fine and put it in a bucket. It isn't necessary to break up or grind the biochar but it allows you to spread it more evenly. Then I soaked it in fertilizer. I used organic fish emulsion but compost tea, liquid manure, or urine work great too.

We have the ability to grind the biochar and sift it. That means we control the particle size. We were able to match the topdress sand particle size.

Jun 09, 2017Enveloped density is the result of biochar mass divided by the envelope volume. We only measured ρ e of biochar before grinding due to instrumental limitation on the minimum particle size measurable. However, grinding biochar into smaller size may result in reduction of intraporosity and thus may affect water storage.

## What is biochar 
Jun 08, 2016Biochar is a type of carbon made from any organic plant materials that have been heated in the absence of oxygen in a process called 'pyrolysis' or 'charring'. The modern term biochar has been adopted to specify a process that uses a non-polluting, sustainable method and resources, i.e. a material that helps mitigate climate change.
