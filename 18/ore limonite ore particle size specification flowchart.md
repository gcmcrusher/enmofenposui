## The feasibility test report of an iron ore in Jiangsu
Oct 14, 2021Most of the magnetite has a particle size of less than 0.1mm, mostly in particulate form. Limonite and hematite mainly exist in the form of colloidal aggregates, and the formation of some limonite is related to multi-stage oxidation. The structural characteristics of limonite ore determine the difficulty of recovery.

## Reduction roasting of limonite ores: effect of dehydroxylation
Sep 01, 2006Calcination of limonite ore was achieved by heating the ore for 20 min at 600 C, or until insignificant change in its weight is observed as a result of dehydroxylation. Calcination was conducted in a muffle furnace. The calcined ore was kept in an oven at 105 C to prevent the re-absorption of free moisture.

Unlike ore fines, its particle size is smaller and hence sintering can't agglomerate it. Therefore, we pelletize concentrates to agglomerate them. Although this process was deployed in the 1940s, it was first used between 1912 and 1913 in Germany and Sweden.

01.01.2017A new hydrometallurgical process for nickel extraction from a low grade laterite ore such as limonite has been developed by RIST and POSCO. This POSCO Nickel Extraction Process (PosNEP) consists of five main processes: ore reduction using hydrogen as a reductant; acid leaching at atmospheric pressure and temperature; cementation by the use of reduced
