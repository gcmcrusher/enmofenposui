Vibro compaction allows the use of economical spread footings with acceptable settlements and design bearing pressures generally in the range of 5 ksf up to 10 ksf. The process also reduces the seismic liquefaction potential. The required treatment depth is designed for each project and is typically in the range of 15 to 50 feet with a maximum depth of 120 feet.

Other vibro replacement design criteria have been considered in the past and are used occasionally, including options to perform the vibro replacement to a certain relative density, to a minimum tip resistance measured by post-treatment CPTs, or to a minimum factor of safety against liquefaction. These criteria are indirectly related to the foundation performance.

Vibro Replacement. The Vibro-flot has groves that spray air or water to the surrounding soil. The equipment can be penetrated into the soil by continuous flushing of air or water to replace the existing spray-poor soil. The soil that is completely replaced is filled using granular material, forming stone columns. This method is called Vibro
