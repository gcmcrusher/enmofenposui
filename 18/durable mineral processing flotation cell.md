## Computational Assessments on Bubble Dynamics Applied to Flotation Cells 
We can define flotation as a single, most significant unit operation in mineral processing, used in extraction of all kinds of minerals. A study of air bubble dynamics and gas-liquid multiphase flow is important for the design, development and understanding of industrial processes such as bubble column reactors, flotation cells and boilers

## pH/ORP measurement Copper flotation process 
A high pH is important in copper ore processing to maximize this mineral's flotation properties. Most copper ore slurries tend to be acidic. Plants typically add lime to the slurry in the mill or floatation circuit, increasing its alkalinity. A typical copper operation contains many flotation cells, often with a pH sensor in each cell.

no flotation can occur. Contact between particles and bubbles can be accomplished in a flotation cell such as the one shown schematically in Figure 5. Figure 5: Simplified schematic of a conventional flotation cell. The rotor draws slurry through the stator and expels it to the sides, creating a suction that draws air down the shaft of the stator.
