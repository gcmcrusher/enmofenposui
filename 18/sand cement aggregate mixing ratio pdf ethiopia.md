Standard Mix. The nominal concrete mix of a fixed proportion of cement, sand and aggregate provide considerable variation in strength resulting in the poor or over-rich mix. Hence minimum compressive strength has been assigned in many proportions and termed as the standard mix. As per IS 456:2000 Standard Concrete grades are M 25, M 30, M 35, M
