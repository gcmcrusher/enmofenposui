## A study on optimum grinding factors for aspheric convex surface micro 
In this paper, an ultra-precision grinding system for manufacturing the aspheric surface micro-lens was developed by considering the factors affecting the grinding surface roughness and profile accuracy. This paper deals with the mirror grinding of an aspheric surface micro-lens by resin-bonded diamond wheel and with the spherical lens of BK7.

Micro-Meister. A rotor spins at maximum speed of 12,000rpm, and generates triturating force between many blades placed around itself. Ultra-precise cutting at micron size levels is achieved, though it has been deemed very difficult so far. The blade ring is available for every 20 pieces of blades planted therein between 50 to 220 pcs.

28.08.2012The development of ultra-precision grinding machines closely followed the technical progression of single-point diamond turning machines. In the early 1980s, IBM funded the development of the so-called lap-grinding machines for grinding ceramic read/write heads, where roughnesses of 10 nm r.m.s. were demanded. This lap-grinding process removed
