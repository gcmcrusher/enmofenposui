In the two stage liquefaction of Wandoan subbituminous coal it was found that the coal was effectively converted into THF-soluble products with high conversion and low hydrogen consumption by pyrolytic procedures in a N 2-tetralin system, using relatively low heating rates, high temperature and short-contact-time conditions.Runs carried out at 440 C (with 2.5 MPa

## Coal Mining 
Coal fields in Arkansas are located in the Arkansas River Valley between the western border of the state and Russellville (Pope County) an area only about thirty-three miles wide and sixty miles long. Until about 1880, most coal mined in Arkansas was used near its original location, often to fuel the fires of blacksmiths. Between 1880 and 1920, coal was Arkansas's first mineral/fuel

Area mining, a type of surface mining used where coal seams are relatively horizontal and the surface terrain is nearly level, accounts for nearly all mining in the Great Plains. Most of the subbituminous coal mined in Wyoming and Montana is shipped out of state for use in coal-fired power plants. In contrast, the lignite of North Dakota
