## hematite 
hematite, also spelled haematite, heavy and relatively hard oxide mineral, ferric oxide (Fe2O3), that constitutes the most important iron ore because of its high iron content (70 percent) and its abundance. Its name is derived from the Greek word for "blood," in allusion to its red colour. Many of the various forms of hematite have separate names. The steel-gray crystals and coarse

## Diamond Mining Methods 
A single blast can break approx. 3,000 tonnes of ore. Once the ore is broken, excavators load the ore into haul trucks and transport it to a primary ore crusher where the diamond extracting process begins. The Kimberley Big Hole is an example of open-pit mining. In underground mining, miners tunnel through Earth's crust to the kimberlite pipe

With few exceptions, Japan's mineral reserves are small, and the quality of those mined is often poor. Coal, iron ore, zinc, lead, copper, sulfur, gold, and silver are among the most abundant minerals (in relative terms), with lesser quantities of tungsten, chromite, and manganese. Japan also has large deposits of limestone. There is an almost complete lack of nickel, cobalt,

## Rare earths 
Magnetic properties. The magnetic properties of rare earth metals, alloys and compounds are highly dependent on the number of unpaired 4f electrons. The metals without unpaired electrons (scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, lutetium, and bivalent ytterbium) are weakly magnetic, as are many of the other non-earth metals.
