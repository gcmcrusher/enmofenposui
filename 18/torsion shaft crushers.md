Because of the close relation between power and torque, the name "shaft power meter" is often used interchangeably with "shaft torque meter" or "shaft torsion meter". Both torque and power can be important values depending on the application.

## 4.6: Torsion of Prismatic Shafts 
4.6.1 Introduction: St. Venant's Theory. From the strength of materials, it is known that for the torsion of a prismatic shaft of a circular cross section, the assumption that cross sections at right angles to the axis of the shaft remain plane in the deformed state leads to a correct solution for the shear stress distribution according to the theory of elasticity.

## Eccentric Shaft 
The first shaft is a pivoting shaft on the top of the crusher, while the other is an eccentric shaft that drives both toggle plates. The moving jaw has a pure reciprocating motion toward the fixed jaw. The crushing force is doubled compared to single toggle crushers and it can crush very hard ores. The jaw crusher is reliable and robust and therefore quite popular in primary crushing
