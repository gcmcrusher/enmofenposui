## stone inlay, epoxy or super
17.07.2008You can buy crushed stone but I think it's pricey so I buy nuggets and make my own. I have this piece of 2 cast iron pipe with a cap on it and I put the turquoise stones in there and take a long drift punch and pound the snot out of it. I then take the crushed stone and fill the inlay and used clear casting resin.

## My first attempt at stone inlay, and I need help! More in comments.
3. level 2. kennerly. 6y. Any stone that you like the look of can be crushed and used as inlay. Of course you want to use stone that has a tolerable hardness. If the stone is too hard you are going to be sanding it forever to get it level and polished. I personally like turquoise. It has a mohs of 5-6 and is pretty easy to work with.
