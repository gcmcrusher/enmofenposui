## What are the risks of coal mining? – AnswersToAll
20.03.2019There are significant environmental impacts associated with coal mining and use. It could require the removal of massive amounts of top soil, leading to erosion, loss of habitat and pollution. Coal mining causes acid mine drainage, which causes heavy metals to dissolve and seep into ground and surface water.

## History of the Coalfields 
During the coal stoppage in 1921 opencast work at Kirkburn disclosed the workings of an old mine of unknown and ancient date. Picks made of stone were found in these workings. Pits are known to have been worked on the Borgie Burn. In the workings of one were found wooden shovels and picks with iron tips.

From the mining of coal to the use of its products, a long trail of pollution can be followed. As consumers, we can do our part by using less energy and using energy efficient appliances. Every time you leave on household appliances — perhaps sometimes unnecessarily — remember that you are at least partly burning coal, an extremely dirty form of power.

Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## Historical Coal Mining in Texas
Most of the coal mining done from the 1800s to the 1920s and 30s (when oil started replacing coal as a fuel source in Texas) used underground methods, where vertical shafts or sloped adits (tunnel entrance) provided access to the mine workings.

## History of coal miners 
Coal miners formed the core of the political left wing of the Labour Party and the British Communist party . In Germany, the coal miners demonstrated their militancy by large-scale strikes in 1889, 1905 and 1912. However, in political terms the German miners were middle-of-the-road and not especially radical.

## 2.7 CH4 Coal Mining Handling 
Underground coal mining releases more methane than surface or open-pit mining because of the higher gas content of deeper seams. Because CH4 is highly explosive in air concentrations between 5 and 15 percent, mine operators have developed two types of systems for removing methane from the underground mine workings: (i)
