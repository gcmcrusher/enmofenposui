## Calcination of Limestone ‚Äì IspatGuru
02.05.2013Calcination of CaCO3 is a highly endothermic reaction, requiring around 755 Mcal of heat input to produce a ton of lime (CaO). The reaction only begins when the temperature is above the dissociation temperature of the carbonates in the limestone. This typically is between 780 deg C and 1340 deg C.
