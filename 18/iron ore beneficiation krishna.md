1. Iron ore - supply and demand outline 1.1 Types of iron ore Iron ores can be classified in different ways. The most important has to do with the iron content. In many cases, ore with a total iron content of 60% to 63%, or greater, is regarded as high grade, and ore with a lower iron content is regarded as low grade.

01.01.2021As the availability of high-grade iron ore is depleting day by day, the low-grade iron ores are exploited and beneficiated to separate the gangue minerals to get the high-grade iron concentration. Generally, the beneficiation process is very ineffective for fine size fractions. These fines are discarded to the tailing pond without further processing and generate large

## Iron Ore Beneficiation Technology By Electrostatic Separation
Almost 100% of mined iron ore is used in steel production, making it essential for everything from staples to buildings. Beneficiation is the term for reducing the size of valuable iron ore particles and separating them from the gange (unusable minerals), which are then discarded. There are several different methods of wet and dry separation.
