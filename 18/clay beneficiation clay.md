beneficiation, acid modification and hydrothermal treatment. The effects of beneficiation and acid modification on Si/Al, catalyst morphology, mineralogical composition of clay-based catalysts were investigated. Further on, the mineralogical phase identity of the produced clay-based zeolite was studied and compared to that of a commercial zeolite.

## Clay 
Clay is a type of fine-grained natural soil material containing clay minerals. Clays develop plasticity when wet, due to a molecular film of water surrounding the clay particles, but become hard, brittle and non–plastic upon drying or firing. Most pure clay minerals are white or light-coloured, but natural clays show a variety of colours from impurities, such as a reddish or

Kaolin is a commercial term used to describe white clay composed essentially of kaolinite. AL4Si4O10(OH)8. The term is typically used to refer to both the raw clay and the refined commercial product. Although originally valued for use in the manufacture of whiteware ceramics, the principal use of kaolin is now in the filling and coating of paper.
