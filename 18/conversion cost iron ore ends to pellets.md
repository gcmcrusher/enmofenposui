27.07.2015Last year, Iran produced 21 MnT of iron pellets, however, its demand reached to 28-29 MnT. KIOCL Shows Trade Interest in Iranian Market. Recently, an Indian pellet maker, KIOCL, finalized a deal with Iran to supply 1 MnT magnetite iron ore (nearly 65%) to Mangalore based 3.5 MnT pellet plant. The pellet produced will be exported back to Iran.

## Direct Reduction Process 
In a DR process, iron ore pellets and/or lump iron ores are reduced by a reducing gas to produce DRI or hot briquetted iron (HBI). Depending on the generation of the reducing gas, two different DR processes are commercially available: gas-based and coal/oil-based. In the gas-based DR process, the reducing gas is produced by chemically reforming
