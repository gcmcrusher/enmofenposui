## Zinc smelting 
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc. Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals, e.g. iron, because in contrast, zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals, zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost, unless

## LEAD ZINC EXTRACTION PROCESSES
are used for production of lead zinc depending on the type of raw material used as a charge. In the pyrometallurgical process, ore concentrate containing lead, zinc, or both is fed, in some cases after sintering, into a primary smelter. Lead concentrations can be 50-70%, and the sulfur content of sulfidic ores is in the range of 15-20%.
