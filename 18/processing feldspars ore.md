## Copper
07.11.2019Copper Solvent Extraction. The separation of copper from nickel is based on the fact that there is an appreciable difference in the pH at which the two metals are extracted. Copper can be extracted, with very small amounts of nickel, at pH 6.0 to 6.5, while nickel is extracted from the copper raffinate at pH 8.0 to 8.2.
