24.03.2021The mill grinding process is almost carried out in two consecutive stages: one is dry grinding (coarse grinding) and the other is wet grinding (fine grinding). The key grinding equipment are ball mills and rod mills, and the latter is now mostly used for wet grinding to finally produce fine and uniform ore products.
