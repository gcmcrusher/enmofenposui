## Dry beneficiation of iron ore 
The haematite ore in South Africa is processed in a dry process to a HQ lump ore with 64 % iron content and a sintered fine ore with 63.5 % iron content. For fine ore beneficiation, wet processes are used. Capacity at the Minas Rio is to be increased from 26.5 Mta capacity to 28 Mta in the forthcoming years.

## Beneficiation of iron ore 
Iron ore is an important mineral commodity because it is the primary source of iron, the metal most widely used by man. World production of iron ore in 1977 was estimated at 840 million tons, and an estimated 350 million tons was shipped in international trade. The United States is the world's fourth largest producer of iron ore and is a major
