Iron ore is present in a number of places and geologic settings within Wisconsin. Iron ore can be defined on the basis of its iron content into low-grade ore (taconite), which commonly contains 25 to 35% iron, and high-grade ore, which contains 50 to 70% iron. Iron-bearing ore minerals include oxides, carbonates, silicates, and, in some cases

03/02/2022Iron ore is a rock from which the metal iron is extracted. About 98% of the world's iron is used to produce steel. Pure iron is an element and a soft grayish-white metal. Other than meteorites that fall from the sky, iron is never found by itself in nature. Most iron is part of minerals that contain other elements.
