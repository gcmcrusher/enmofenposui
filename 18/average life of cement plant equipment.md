## Cement Production 
Cement production is one of the largest industries in the world. Annual world production in 2013 was approximately 4 GT (of which, about half was in China). It is produced in kilns at around 1400o C (2500 o F), and approximately 750 kg (1650 lb) of CO 2 are released for each tonne (2205 lb.) that is made.

## How to calculate the life cycle cost of equipment. 
Jul 28, 2019Why you need to calculate the life cycle cost of equipment. If you only had limited plant and equipment, life cycle cost wouldn't be quite so critical. However, as modern businesses have so much operational plant and so many pieces of equipment, it's imperative to manage all your assets correctly in terms of productivity and safety.

## Clinkerization 
The liquid percentage at 1450 0 C can be estimated using the formula. % Liquid content (1450 0C) = 3.0 x A+2.25 x F+S. Where A=Al 2 O, F=Fe 2 O 3, S= MgO+K 2 O+Na 2 O+SO 3 In Clinker. The normal range of liquid phase is 22-27%. Burnability is a reference value for raw meal indicating how difficult it is to burn.
