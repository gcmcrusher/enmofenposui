Abstract This paper analyzes the results of MnO reduction from manganese ore and ferromanganese slag obtained at NTNU (Trondheim) and UNSW (Sydney). Manganese ore upon melting consists of two phases: solid MnO phase which may be a pure MnO oxide or a MnO-MgO solid solution and liquid slag. The process of manganese ore reduction includes MnO phase

## reduction process of manganese oxides to mno
Reduction of manganese ore in the solid state at temperatures below 1100–1200C by solid carbon, hydrogen or carbon monoxide does not go beyond MnO. Using methane-containing gas, manganese oxides can be reduced to manganese carbides at relatively low temperatures when manganese ore is solid.2) Manganese oxide MnO is reduced to manganese carbide

## Problems related to processing of manganese ore fines.
01.09.2010The process of jigging is used for upgrading the ores in the size range of 25 mm + 1 mm. The ores below 1 mm are presently treated by tables and spirals. However these processes have their limitations in treating fines. The other methods of separations used for manganese ores are magnetic separation and flotation.
