## gold processing 
The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below).

## Guidelines for Construction Cost Estimating for Dam 
A major factor in Project go/no go decisions is the economic benefit of the project compared to the overall project cost. Market volatility, particularly between 2000 and 2010, highlights the importance of reliable construction cost estimates during design and project development. USSD decided to address this topic in a paper after noting that in

## Processes 
The slurry and water flowed relatively slowly in the sand stratum, so the laminar flow model was chosen. The slurry flowed in the y direction, with the inlet (y = 0) set to be the pressure inlet and the outlet (y = 5 cm) set to be the pressure outlet. Cement slurry with a water–cement ratio of 1 was used as the grouting material.

## Introduction to Biogas Technology
Slurry fed is allowed to undergo anaerobic fermentation in the digester. Gas produced as a result rises up and gets collected in the dome. As the pressure of gas stored in the dome increases, it pushes up the slurry down and causes the slurry level to increase both in inlet and outlet tanks.

Archimedes Principle states that the buoyant force on a submerged object is equal to the weight of the fluid that is displaced by the object. One day, while getting into his bath the Greek inventor and mathematician Archimedes noticed water spilling over the sides. In a flash he realised the relationship between the water that had fallen out and the weight of his body - in other words
