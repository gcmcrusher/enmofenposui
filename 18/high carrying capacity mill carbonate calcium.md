## Final Report Summary 
Within the calcium carbonate looping process, two hot gas streams at a high temperature level are used for steam generation: the CO2-depleted flue gas from the carbon-ator at 650 C and the CO2-rich stream from the calciner at 900 C. The heat that needs to be extract-ed from the carbonator is supplied to the secondary power cycle as the third heat source.

## White Paper: Evaporator Issues and Technology 
31.10.2018Like all pulp mill unit operations, evaporators can have operating issues due to the processes occurring inside the system or due to the complex mill chemistry. Almost all these issues fall into six main categories including scaling, corrosion, liquor carry-over, vacuum issues, condensate segregation and foaming liquor.

A particular feature of calcium bicarbonate is that it only exists in the dissolved form; when it precipitates, it does so in the calcium carbonate form, one that is only slightly soluble and it can only remain in water when it is balanced out by available CO 2: As the CO 2 content has an influence on pH, we can conclude that, for a given

Calcium carbonate specific gravity is 2.7 g/cm3 compared to a general range of 0.90 to 0.96 g/cm3 for most polyolefins. This means 1 gram of calcium carbonate occupies approximately 1/3 the volume of 1 gram of polyolefin polymer. Outputs must be compared on a volume rather than weight basis .
