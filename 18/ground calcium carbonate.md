## Synthesis of precipitated calcium carbonate: a review
09.03.2017PCCs have a lot of advantages over natural and ground calcium carbonate with their unique properties of smaller particle size, high purity, narrow particle size distribution and regular crystal shape (Gill 1995). Unlike ground calcium carbonate, PCCs can be produced in different crystal shapes and in ultrafine particle sizes.
