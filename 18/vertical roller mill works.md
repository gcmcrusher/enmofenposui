## How the Mill Works 
At Gray's Mill, a Sluice Gate was used to start and stop the flow of water from the mill pond across the road. The Sluice Gate was opened by a turning Sluice Wheel, which starts the flow of water, causing the water wheel to turn, thus providing power to grind the grain. Eventually, as water levels in the mill pond became unreliable, drying
