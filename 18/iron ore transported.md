## Iron Ore Statistics and Information 
Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.

## How Was Iron Made 
Iron was found in rocks called iron ore. Making iron from iron ore (smelting) needed very high temperatures. Techniques for making iron were first developed in the Middle East, some time after 1550 BCE. Ironworking gradually spread westward, reaching Britain by 700 BCE. Iron was harder than bronze, which had been used to make objects before.
