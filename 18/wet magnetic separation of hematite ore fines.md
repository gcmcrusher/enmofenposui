## Beneficiation of fine ores using the Longi wet high magnetic separator 
Magnetic separation has been used since 1955 for processing a variety of minerals from iron ore in steel production to the desulphurisation of coal. The accumulation of such fines and slimes during mining operations and the increasing global demand for quality products motivated the use of the semi-continuous pilot wet high intensity magnetic separator (WHIMS) introduced in 2008.
