Ball Milling. Ball milling and subsequent annealing is a simple method for the production of CNTs. Although it is well established that mechanical attrition of this type can lead to fully nano porous microstructures, it was not until a few years ago that CNTs of carbon and boron nitride were produced from these powders by thermal annealing.

In other words, the liner lives and their replacement, define the time available for mineral processing. For every hour that the concentrator is shut-down due to liner exchange (Grinding Mill Relining) the mine site asset loses $50K to $500K per hour of revenue, depending on the mine head grade, through-put and commodity prices.

The process can be performed at room temperature and homogeneous nanocomposite powders can be produced. In this paper, we investigated the effect of different ball milling parameters and operating conditions (milling time, ball size, processing control agent (PCA) and speed) in mechanical alloying of aluminum powder to achieve particle size.
