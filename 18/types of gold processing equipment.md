## Processes Wire Bonding Gold Wire Bonding 
Gold wire bonding is the process by which gold wire is attached to two points in an assembly to form an interconnection or an electrically conductive path. Heat, ultrasonics, and force are all employed to form the attachment points for the gold wire. The process of creating the attachment point begins with the formation of a gold ball at the tip of the wire bond tool, the capillary.

##  The Basics of Successful Gold Mining
Most successful river miners use the following technique to locate and recover pay-streaks: First, locate a proven gold producing section of the river. By digging or dredging sample holes, locate the main gold path. More sample holes are continued along the path until a pay-streak is located.

## Activated Carbon in Gold Cyanidation 
The gold cyanidation process is a primary method of gold beneficiation. Activated carbon is a critical component in the beneficiation of gold ore, allowing this widespread process to occur because of its ability to recover gold from the gold-cyanide complex. Depending on the deposit, some silver ores may also be processed via cyanidation.
