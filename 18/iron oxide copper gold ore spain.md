## Are You Fooled by Fool's Gold? Identify Pyrite in 2 Minutes
08.08.20221 Pyrite's specific gravity is smaller than gold. Gold ore weighs about 4 times as much as pyrite at the same volume size. 2 Pyrite is harder than real gold. Gold has a Mohs hardness of 3, while pyrite is 6, which is not easy to scratch. 3 Real gold turns red. The gold mine has some red hues, while fool's gold does not.

Aug 08, 20221 Pyrite's specific gravity is smaller than gold. Gold ore weighs about 4 times as much as pyrite at the same volume size. 2 Pyrite is harder than real gold. Gold has a Mohs hardness of 3, while pyrite is 6, which is not easy to scratch. 3 Real gold turns red. The gold mine has some red hues, while fool's gold does not.
