Statistics and information on the worldwide supply of, demand for, and flow of the mineral commodity strontium. Strontium commonly occurs in nature, averaging 0.034% of all igneous rock; only two minerals, celestite (strontium sulfate) and strontianite (strontium carbonate), however, contain strontium in sufficient quantities to make its

Animal studies demonstrated that high doses of strontium induced alterations of mineralization and, in a rat model of chronic renal failure, high strontium doses induced mineralization defects, with a corresponding 160-fold accumulation of strontium in bone. Studies indicated that the accumulation of metals in bone might be synergistic.
