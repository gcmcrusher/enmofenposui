Milling (machining) . Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved
