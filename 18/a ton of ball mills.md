Aug 10, 20201. Fill the container with small metal balls. Most people prefer to use steel balls, but lead balls and even marbles can be used for your grinding. Use balls with a diameter between (13 mm) and (19 mm) inside the mill. The number of balls is going to be dependent on the exact size of your drum.
