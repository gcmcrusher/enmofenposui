The present research aimed to develop natural rubber (NR) hybrid composites reinforced with calcium carbonate/carbon black (CC/CB) and calcium carbonate/silica (CC/SC). The influence of CC/CB and CC/SC with various filler ratios (120/0, 90/5, 60/10, 30/15 and 0/20) on cure characteristics and mechanical properties of the vulcanizates was investigated and their

Conclusions. The TGA analysis shows our calcium carbonate sample to have a calcium carbonate purity of as much as 96.97% by weight. The XRF analysis says the purity cannot be greater than 96.38 wt.%, but the XRF does not tell us what portion of the 96.38 wt.% of the Ca is in the form of calcium carbonate.
