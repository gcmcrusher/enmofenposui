## Influence of work
26.04.2022The results reveal that high-fidelity transfer depends not only on roll grinding deviation amplitudes and mill loading, but also on the specific locations of deviations along the roll face length due to 3D bulk roll-stack deformations as well as effective stiffness ratio between the work roll and the strip. Concluding the study is a novel
