Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

## Ball Milling The Role of Media and Bead Mills 
Ball Milling: Ball milling is a grinding technique that uses media to effectively break down pigment agglomerates and aggregates to their primary particles. Using a rotor or disc impeller to create collisions of the grinding media, the impact and force created by the bead mills collisions break down the pigment agglomerates.

## Ball Milling 
Ball milling is a mechanical technique that is broadly used to grind powders into fine particles [134–141]. The reactants are generally broken apart using solvent molecules in the traditional method; but in ball milling, reactants are broken by using mechanical forces. The term mechanochemistry has been introduced very recently [142].
