gypsum was 18.0 million tons. Synthetic gypsum is mainly produced as a byproduct in flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems. Calcined gypsum is produced domestically from crude gypsum by heating selenite. In the United States, gypsum is primarily used to manufacture wallboard and plaster for homes, offices, and commercial buildings.
