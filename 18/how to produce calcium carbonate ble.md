## Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) 
17.11.2021Calcium carbonate is a white mineral that occurs naturally in chalk, limestone, and marble, and is the main mineral that forms mollusk shells, stony corals, and pearls. For horticultural purposes, calcium carbonate is most often used to produce a more alkaline soil, usually through the application of lime. Advertisement.
