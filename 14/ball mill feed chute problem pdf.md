## Ball Mill 
18.11.20085. Abstract The Ball mill is one of the most important equipment in the world of chemical engineering. It is used in grinding materials like ores, chemicals, etc. The types of ball mills: batch ball mill and continuous ball mill with different grinding media and different design depend on the nature of the input material and the nature of the

## Increasing drying efficiency by modifying the design of feed chute 
Pelletizing plant of the Gol-E-Gohar mining and industrial company consists of a burner, a dry ball mill (6.2 m 13 m), and an air separator. The ball mill consists of a 2 m-long drying and an 11 m-long grinding chambers. The iron ore concentrate is fed to the drying chamber by a feed chute. It was found that when the feed moisture content increased from 1.3% to 3.5%, the throughput

## A Practical Guide to Rotary Valves
Rotary Valves are one of the most common means of feeding pneumatic conveying systems, both pressure and vacuum types. There are many other applications where they are used simply for metering of a controlled feed rate. Given the great numbers of these items in use, it may be tempting to think that the selection of Rotary
