21.10.2021In this study, two limestone quarries, namely Quarry-1 and Quarry-2 were investigated in terms of the Schmidt Hammer Rebound (SHR) distribution. A total of 518 points, i.e., 158 points for Quarry-1 and 360 points for Quarry-2, were tested and evaluated in terms of SHR, respectively. Both quarries were represented with their corresponding SHR distribution.
