## Particle Shape 
Particle size and particle shape: 1 to 3000m. Learn More. Particle shape, also named as particle morphology, is currently characterized by measuring and calculating the projected shapes of the particles, including outline contour and roughness. All historical methods employ microscopic imaging systems as the basis of performing an image analysis.

## Multiphase particle
History. The multiphase particle-in-cell (MP-PIC) method was originally developed for a one-dimensional case in the mid-1990s by P.J. O'Rourke (Los Alamos National Laboratory), who also coined the term MP-PIC.Subsequent extension of the method to two-dimensions was performed by D.M. Snider and O'Rourke. By 2001, D.M. Snider had extended the MP-PIC method to full

## Effect of Tailings Fine Content on the Properties of Cemented Paste 
02.06.2021According to the particle packing theory, when the fine content is less than 42.20%, the tailings are relatively coarse at this time. As the content of fine particles increases, the fine particles continue to fill the voids among the coarse particles, resulting in a significant increase in the overall packing density. This effect is called the filling effect of fine particles .

## SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION OF COAL 
It turns out that even at atmospheric temprerature, the coal reacts slowly with the oxygen in the environment releasing small amounts of heat in an exothermic reaction [2]. This is a problem for large pile of coal as the heat can accumulate, pushing the temperatures upward. If the coal becomes hot enough for combustion reactions to occur

Coal washing Coal that comes from a mine is a complex mixture of materials with a large variety of physical properties. In addition to the coal itself, pieces of rock, sand, and various minerals are contained in the mixture. Thus, before coal can be sold to consumers, it must be cleaned. The cleaning process consists of a number of steps that results in a product that is specifically

01.08.1991Ignition of an isolated single coal particle is known to occur either heterogeneously or homogeneously. While single-particle studies may be useful for dilute coal sprays, their application to burners is limited since ignition occurs in the vicinity of the burners where the spray is dense. Rather than considering an isolated particle, one must consider a collection of
