04/10/2017All cements, including the CEM1 cements, are allowed 5% minor constituents which is usually limestone. Thus, a CEM I consists of between 95-100% clinker where the CEM2 – 5 cements can range 20-94% clinker. Blended cement is obtained by mixing CEM1 with mineral admixtures or additives like fly ash, slag, silica fume and limestone.

KAUST's novel cement blend achieves a significant carbon load reduction by replacing a portion of OPC used in concrete with a geopolymer cement containing pozzolan. The pozzolan is a finely divided material that reacts with calcium hydroxide and alkalis to form compounds possessing cementitious properties. The cement blend uses natural pozzolan

Blended cements with 450 m2/kg Blaine fineness were produced from a Turkish volcanic tuff in a laboratory mill by intergrinding Portland cement clinker, natural pozzolan, and gypsum. The effects of 35, 45, and 55 wt.% natural pozzolan addition on the properties of these blended cement pastes and mortars were investigated.
