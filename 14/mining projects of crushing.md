First the rock will enter the crushing chamber and drop as far as the angle of the crushing surface will allow it to. The crusher "breaks it and the fine material produced will drop through the gap between the mantle and the liner as it opens. The coarse material that can't fall through will remain to be crushed with the next gyration.
