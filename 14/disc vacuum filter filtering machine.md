## Rotary vacuum
A Rotary Vacuum Filter Drum consists of a cylindrical filter membrane that is partly sub-merged in a slurry to be filtered. The inside of the drum is held lower than the ambient pressure. As the drum rotates through the slurry, the liquid is sucked through the membrane, leaving solids to cake on the membrane surface while the drum is submerged.

A white wine that has been poorly fined and still has solids in suspension will require a coarse filtering using a No. 1 pad followed by a No. 2. A No. 3 filtering might also be required. Let the wine clarify naturally as much as possible before filtering. The second consideration is the total filtering surface area.

Each disc is made up of several pie-shaped sections. Disc filters can operate as either vacuum disc filters or pressurized disc filters. Because a pressure differential is applied across both disc faces, the effective filter area of a disc filter is much greater than that of a drum filter requiring the same floor space.
