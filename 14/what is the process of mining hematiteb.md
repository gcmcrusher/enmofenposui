## Modeling analysis of block generation process of the mining 
The mining process is assumed to be a time-continuous Markov process, so the mining time obeys an exponential distribution. In addition, the number of miners in the pool is assumed to be c . Therefore, this paper simulates the block generation process using a batch service M/M/ c queueing model with repairable fault, vacation and feedback.

With 5 mines, 4 processing hubs and 2 port facilities, our Pilbara iron ore business is all connected by more than 1,000 kilometres of rail infrastructure. At each mining hub ore from the mines is crushed, beneficiated (where necessary) and blended to create high-grade hematite lump and fines products.

## How Is Hematite Mined And Processed 
Hematite and magnetite ore processing includes crushing, screening and grinding to produce hematite lumps and fines. Magnetite ore is further processed through magnetic separation, an important process in producing magnetite iron concentrate. Pelletising is a treatment process used for very fine or powdery ores.
