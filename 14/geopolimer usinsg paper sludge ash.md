Geopolymers. Prof. Davidovits, in 1972, submitted application for patenting the use of geopolymer as construction material. He, then, proposed a term Polysialate (Polysilicon-oxo-aluminate) to define a series of aluminosilicate binders activated with alkaline solutions at IUPAC conference, and finally, a denotation geopolymer was coined to Polysialate [70,71,72].

Geopolymer concrete, unlike ordinary concrete, includes heavy aluminium and silica industrial wastes like fly ash and rice husks, GGBS Metakolin etc. In this study to make the geopolymer concrete more sustainable we use dry waste sludge available locally and partially removed the fly ash in the proportion of 25%, 50% 75% and 100% with

## Pulp and paper mill wastes: utilizations and prospects for high 
A wide variety of biomass is available all around the world. Most of the biomass exists as a by-product from manufacturing industries. Pulp and paper mills contribute to a higher amount of these biomasses mostly discarded in the landfills creating an environmental burden. Biomasses from other sources have been used to produce different kinds and grades of

Geopolymer mortar is the best solution as an alternative to cement mortar in civil engineering. This paper deals with the effect of geopolymer mortar on the strength and microstructural properties under ambient curing conditions. In this research, geopolymer mortars were prepared with fly ash and steel slag (in the ratio 1:2.0, 1:2.5 and 1:3.0) as precursors

## Evaluation of the long
This paper aimed to evaluate the long-term compressive strength development of the sewage sludge ash/metakaolin (SSA/MK)–based geopolymer. SSA/MK–based geopolymeric mortars and pastes were produced at 25C with different SSA contents (0 - 30 wt.%). Compressive strength tests were run within the 3-720 curing days range.

## Solidification and stabilisation of metal plating sludge with fly ash 
The disposal of metal plating sludge (PS) to landfills is an increasingly common practice in developed and developing countries. This paper presents a novel PS stabilisation technique using fly ash (FA)-based geopolymers as a waste management option. Strength and microstructural evaluations were carried out on PS-FA geopolymers at various values of

There-fore, instead of heat treatment, the other important factors for synthesizing the geopolymer matrix in the soft soil environment, is the main focusing of this paper. The Taguchi method was used to determine the most important factor that affects several properties of geopolymer modified sludge by minimizing the effects of variation, but without eliminating the cause.

Paper sludge pretreatment The paper sludge-based dryactivators were prepared by mixing 6.3M NaOH with increasing amount of paper sludge (see Table 2) using a dispersing instrument (IKA T25 Ultra Turrax) for approxi-mately 4min. The mixed sludge were then dried in the oven at 95 C for two days. The resultant ﬂakes as seen in Fig. 2, were then
