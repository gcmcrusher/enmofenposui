## Used Belt Over Roller Conveyor For Sale 
The roller conveyor system is used to maintain product position and is designed for use in decline and incline conveyor systems. Belt over roller conveyors can support heavier loads due to the 1.9-inch diameter rollers. This type of conveyor has less friction than a slider bed conveyor because of the belt riding on top of the bed of rollers.
