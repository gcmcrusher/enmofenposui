## Introduction Of Grinder Machine 
Introduction of Grinding Machines. Grinding machines produce flat, cylindrical, and other surfaces through highspeed rotating abrasive wheels. Grinding is a means of giving a more accurate finish to a part already machined but is also a machining process in its own right. The main types of machine are the surface grinding machine for . 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Types of

Machining is a process in which a material (often metal) is cut to a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The processes that have this common theme are collectively called subtractive manufacturing, which utilizes machine tools, in contrast to additive manufacturing (3D printing), which uses controlled addition of material.
