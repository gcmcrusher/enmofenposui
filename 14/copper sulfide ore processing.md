## Processing oxide
The method of processing copper raw material into copper oxide is suggested and investigated. This method is based on the decomposition of copper oxide and sulfide by ammonium chloride with the subsequent leaching of chloride compounds of copper and the precipitation of copper hydroxide from the solution. The thermodynamics is calculated, and a

These minerals are spread throughout the rock as separate grains – 'porphyritic' nodules and thin veinlets. The usual grades for such polymetallic ore types are 0.3-0.6% copper, 0.1-0.2% zinc, and 0.1-0.01% molybdenum. The porphyritic ore features the tight intergrowth of sulfide minerals, and different sizes of sulfide minerals tend to

Porphyry deposits containing the largest reserves have an average grade of 0.25% and often contain elevated concentrations of arsenic in comparison to the deposits that supplied most copper before the 20th century. The current copper porphyry processing scheme first concentrates sulfide ores via froth flotation, then smelts these concentrates.

Copper can be extracted from sulfide ores (usually higher grade ores) by direct smelting. The earliest evidence of copper smelting occurs in Serbian artefacts dating from around 5000 BC. Copper can be extracted from oxide ores using electrolysis (electrowinning) for low grade ores, or by the carbon reduction method of smelting for higher grade ores. The process of
