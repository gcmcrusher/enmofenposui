Athabasca Oil Sands The main drainage of the area is provided by the Athabasca- Clear water System. Only 20% of the oil sands lie near the surface where they can be easily be mined, and these deposits flank the Athabasca river. The rest of the oil sands are buried more than 75m.

The Athabasca Oil Sands Project is the latest fully integrated oil sands development in 25 years. ConocoPhillips launched the Surmont SAGD pilot project comprising two 350m-long well pairs in 1997, and made the first 3D seismic acquisition in 1998. The third well pair, measuring about 700m, was drilled in 2000.

01.09.2016A typical oil sands deposit in Alberta contains on average about 10% bitumen, 5% water and 85% solids, mostly in the form of coarse silica sand. Oil sands also contain fine solids and clays, typically in the range of 10 to 30% by weight. Bitumen is a heavy complex hydrocarbon, contained within the oil sands deposit.

## Alberta Oil Sands History and Milestones 
History. Alberta's oil sands were formed millions of years ago, as tiny marine creatures died and drifted to the sea floor and were covered by layers of sediment that exerted enough pressure and temperatures to transform the organic matter into oil. Over millions of years, that oil became trapped in thick layers of sand.

## Apr 30 Evolution of Mining Equipment in the Oil Sands
30/04/2016OIL SANDS MINING: A BRIEF HISTORY. Suncor Energy (then known as Great Canadian Oil Sands) began mining the Athabasca oil sands in the mid-1960s. Bucketwheels and mobile conveyors were initially employed at the mine site. The bucketwheels were phased out in the early 1990s as the company transitioned to truck-and-shovel, which is the technology

## Oil Sands From Athabasca – Alternative Energy HQ
The Athabasca oil sands are named for the Athabasca River, where the oil sands are easily seen from the river banks. One third of the world's oil sands are found here in Alberta, Canada and in Venezuela. The Athabasca oil sands field is unique in that the oil sands are located very near the surface and can be easily surface mined.

## Here's how oil sands mining works 
26/05/2020There are two main ways of getting oil out of oil sands: open pit mining and in situ. 9. If bitumen is found less than 75 metres from the surface, the area can become an open pit mine. 10 Around 20 percent of Alberta's oil sands are close enough to the surface for open pit mining. 11. Companies create open-pit mines by first clearing land of

07/02/2013Oil sands are the most important of the oil and gas resources in Canada. So the distribution and evaluation of oil sands form a critical basis for risk investment in Canada. Distribution of oil sands resources is severely controlled by the reservoir heterogeneity. Deterministic modeling is commonly used to solve the heterogeneity problems in the reservoir,
