## Definition of crushing strength
Definition of crushing strength. i. The resistance that a rock offers to vertical pressure placed upon it. It is measured by applying graduated pressure to a cube, 1 in (2.54 cm) square, of the rock tested. A crushing strength of 4,000 lb means that a cubic inch of the rock withstands pressure to 4,000 lb (111 kg/cm 3 ) before crushing.
