The most common alteration assemblage is albite-chlorite-hematite-magnetite +/- silica, which is locally overprinted by later iron-oxide, silica, sericite or carbonate alteration. Oxygen isotope analyses in conjunction with fluid inclusions indicate precipitation temperatures for the mineralized zones in the range 340 to 400 C and 1750 to 4500 bars.

## Bisha Project, Eritrea 
Bisha Project is located at about 150km west of Asmara in Eritrea, East Africa. The mining project is a major deposit of volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) mineralisation. The VMS mineralisation is rich in base and precious metals such as gold and silver oxides, as well as copper and zinc sulphides. Bisha is the first-of-its kind in Eritrea to

A major geological boundary runs across the National Park, generally from north-west to south-east, mostly beneath the waters of Lough Leane and Muckross Lake. It separates a mountainous area of Devonian rocks to south and west from a plain underlain by Carboniferous rocks to north and east. The Devonian rocks, generally referred to as Old Red
