## Vermiculite Concrete
Vermiculite Concrete Introduction Vermiculite concrete is a low density non-structural construction product. It is insulating (both thermally and acoustically) and intrinsically fire resistant. It is normally made simply by mixing exfoliated vermiculite as the aggregate, with cement and water, plus additives such as plasticisers if required.

In the coarse aggregate concrete with a particle size of 5-10mm, the interface crack width is relatively uniform, only 0.03mm, and the crack length is only 1/6 of the particle size perimeter. For coarse aggregates with different particle sizes, the accumulation of water sacs formed at the lower part of the particle size after concrete hardening is also different.

Aggregates. Aggregates are inert granular materials such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone that, along with water and portland cement, are an essential ingredient in concrete. For a good concrete mix, aggregates need to be clean, hard, strong particles free of absorbed chemicals or coatings of clay and other fine materials that could cause the
