## How to calculate conveyor speed in feet per minute
When Enercon sizes a cap sealing system for an application we rely on the conveyor speed expressed in feet per minute (FPM). For a quick estimate of fpm simply follow the formula below: (cpm) / (# containers per foot) = fpm. For example if you can fit 5 containers within one foot of conveyor and you know your cpm is 100: (100 cpm) / (5 cont/ft
