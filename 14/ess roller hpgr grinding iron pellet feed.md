## Applications 
Here, the roller press is used to grind coarse feed material by applying a high pressure between the rollers. While high-pressure comminution is already a well-accepted and proven technology in the cement industry ( read more ), it has also increasingly penetrated applications in the processes of iron ore pre-crushing and pellet feed

May 27, 2021One pilot-scale high-pressure grinding roll with cheek plates and another with flanges have been tested in size reduction of iron ore pellet feed. These have been simulated using DEM-MBD with a new particle replacement model (PRM) in EDEM™, allowing to study the effects of specific force and roll velocity.
