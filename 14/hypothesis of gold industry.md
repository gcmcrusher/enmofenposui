## Hypothesis and types of variables 
. Types of variables Discrete variable: It is the one which involves counting the number of events. It consists of only whole numbers; fractional values can't occur. e.g. the number of inhabitants in a village Continuous variable: They are divisible into smaller and smaller fractional units. e.g. age of farmer.

## Gold 
In pure form gold has a metallic luster and is sun yellow, but mixtures of other metals, such as silver, copper, nickel, platinum, palladium, tellurium, and iron, with gold create various color hues ranging from silver-white to green and orange-red. Pure gold is relatively soft--it has about the hardness of a penny.

In this experiment, Rutherford used Gold Foil which was extremely thin sheet, not more than 1000 atoms thick. Gold Foil was bombarded with positively charged α-particles. He used α-particles because they are very energetic and are heavier than other particles. They are approximately 4 times heavier than Hydrogen atoms.

Second, the environment is a source of hypothesis, because environment portrays broad relationship across factors which form the basis for drawing an inference. Third, analogies are a source of hypothesis. The term analogies refer to parallelism.
