Oil-sand deposits are an important source of crude oil in Canada and Venezuela. But the potential environmental cost of exploiting them is high. The extraction process can leave behind noxious waste products; and for every barrel of synthetic oil produced from oil-sands in Alberta, Canada, more than 80 kg of greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere.
