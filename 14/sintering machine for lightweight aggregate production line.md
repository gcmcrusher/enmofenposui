## Materials 
During the sintering process, preheating at 400 C was applied prior to sintering at 1150 C in order to avoid sudden expansion, which leads to cracking due to the high heat supply, thus negatively affecting the properties of the aggregates formed. The artificial aggregates were noted as capable for lightweight application due to the results obtained, such as the density,
