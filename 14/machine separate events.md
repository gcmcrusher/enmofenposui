## Finite State Machines 
The Finite State Machine is an abstract mathematical model of a sequential logic function. It has finite inputs, outputs and number of states. FSMs are implemented in real-life circuits through the use of Flip Flops. The implementation procedure needs a specific order of steps (algorithm), in order to be carried out.

## Deep learning vs. machine learning: What's the difference?
23.01.2020To recap, the key differences between machine learning and deep learning are: Machine learning uses algorithms to parse data, learn from that data, and make informed decisions based on what it has learned. Deep learning structures algorithms in layers to create an "artificial neural network" that can learn and make intelligent decisions on
