A mass that sticks together. Makes up part of a planet such as Earth, especially in its outer crust. An ore also is a mixture of one or more minerals. We distinguish ore from rock in that a valuable and/or useful material can be mined or extracted from the ore. This material often is a metal. Iron ore, for example, is mined for its iron content.
