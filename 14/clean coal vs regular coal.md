## Why Brown Coal Should Stay in the 
The coal industry claims it can solve these problems with "clean coal". In the greenhouse context, "clean coal" is a contradiction in terms. "Clean coal" is a marketing term invented in the 1970s and 1980s in an attempt to counter the linkage between coal and acid rain caused by coal's sulphur content. The term covers a

## Carbon capture
31/05/2006By raising the pressure and temperature of the generated steam to supercritical conditions, power plant efficiency is increased, making more electricity from less coal and reducing CO 2 emissions compared to a conventional plant. Supercritical plant can be 'retrofitted' to existing coal plants, using the existing infrastructure at the site.
