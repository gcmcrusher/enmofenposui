## Pulverized coal
The raw coal is then fed into the pulverizer along with air heated to about 650 F (340 C) from the boiler. As the coal gets crushed by the rolling action, the hot air dries it and blows out the usable fine coal powder to be used as fuel. The powdered coal from the pulverizer is directly blown to a burner in the boiler.

## Coal Pulverizer
Description Pulverization is currently the favored method of preparing coal for burning. Mechanically pulverizing coal into a fine powder enables it to be burned like a gas, thus allowing more efficient combustion. Transported by an air or an air/gas mixture, pulverized coal can be introduced directly into the boiler for combustion.
