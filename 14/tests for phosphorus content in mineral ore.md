The NaHCO 3 extractant (Olsen et al., 1954) can remove Ca-phosphates and phosphate adsorbed on surfaces of calcium and magnesium carbonates along with Al-phosphates and is considered the most suitable P test for these soils. A water extract removes dissolved forms of P but very little of the adsorbed and mineral forms.
