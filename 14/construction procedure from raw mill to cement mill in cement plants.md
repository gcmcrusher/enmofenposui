## Vertical Raw Mill for Cement Raw Meal Grinding in Cement 
Vertical raw mill is widely used in cement industry. In the process of cement production in cement plant, cement raw meal needs to be ground by grinding equipment before calcination. Cement raw meal includes limestone, gypsum, silica, clay, fly ash and other components. Because these materials are mixed together and have special properties, so

## How is Cement Manufactured and Processed? 
An integrated cement manufacturing process is that prepares the raw mix, feeds it to the pyro-processing system (kiln), and then grinds the clinker from the kiln system into various cement products. Finished cement is stored in large silos on site or bagged for small quantity use. Crushing process: The raw materials mainly limestone, clay, coke

Following is the procedure of manufacture of cement by the dry process using modern technology: (1) Most of the cement factories are loca. All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks.

## The cement mill 
Cement manufacturing -brief description of a cement mill. Cement clinker is usually ground using a ball mill. This is essentially a large rotating drum containing grinding media - normally steel balls. As the drum rotates, the motion of the balls crushes the clinker. The drum rotates approximately once every couple of seconds.

It has been observed from different studies on the clinker–raw-coal interrelationship in some Indian cement plants that an ash content of up to 28%–30% can be tolerated for burning Indian raw materials, without appreciably affecting kiln operations and clinker quality. However, in the precalciner system, where available, lower-grade coal (up to 40% ash) can be used for partial
