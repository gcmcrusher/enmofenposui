Mineral extraction is fundamentally driven by large scale mining operations. However, production of gold by small-scale miners has seen a considerable increase since a law to legalise small-scale mining was enacted in 1989. Ghana is thus well endowed with substantial mineral resources, the major ones being gold, diamonds, manganese and bauxite.

Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most
