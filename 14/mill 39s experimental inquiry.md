## Experimental Mill Inquiry 
Experimental Mill Inquiry. Inquiry is a process used by human beings to seek information and understanding (Welch, et al., 1981) and is applicable across domains of knowledge. The internal work of inquiry is learning to reason based on evidence and it involves the ability to think about how one "knows" the subject at hand. Inquiry experiential inquiry-based learning.

Mill's Methods are five methods of induction described by philosopher John Stuart Mill in his 1843 book A System of Logic.

## mill 39 s experimental inquiry
Mill's methods of inductive reasoning are, in part, an extension of Bacon's scientific work. These methods form the backbone of inductive science. His methods are essentially simple to understand, but, discovering how these patterns emerge in historical case studies of experimental inquiry can, at times, be quite challenging.

With his methods of experimental inquiry, it was Mill's aim to develop means of induction that would promote a search for causes. Mill recognized induction as a process whereby one generalizes from experience but it was his belief, beyond that, that all induction involves a search for causes, and that his methods were intended to support this.
