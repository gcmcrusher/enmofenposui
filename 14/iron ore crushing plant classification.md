## Classification Process Of Iron Ore In Mining 
Jul 27 2018 The accurate classification of iron ores is one of the challenging tasks in the mining industry and at the same time it is essential for the future destination of the ores. The present study attempts to develop a machine-vision-based system combining feature extraction feature selection and image classification in order to predict the class of the iron ores.

.1 Iron Ore Composition Iron very rarely occurs in the earth's surface as a metal. It is widely distributed, combined with oxygen as iron oxides. In fact it is believed that iron makes up about 5% by weight of the earth's crust. Geologists recognise various types of iron ore, classified chiefly according to iron (Fe) content (see Table 1 below).

Iron Ore. India is rich in good quality iron ores. Magnetite is the finest iron ore with a very high content of iron upto 70%. This iron ore is valuable for the electrical industry because of its excellent magnetic properties. Hematite ore is the most important industrial iron ore; in terms of usage. The iron content of hematite is 50-60%.

## The case for wet processing iron ore 
Depending on the ore type, quality and its degree of degradation, a washing and classifying plant can increase the iron content by two to five per cent, while reducing the silica, alumina, titanium oxide, sulfur and phosphorous content through removal of fines below 0.063 mm by washing. For example, decreasing the alumina content reduces the
