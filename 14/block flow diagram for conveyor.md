## How Do Conveyor Belts Work? 
A conveyor belt works by using two motorized pulleys that loop over a long stretch of thick, durable material. When motors in the pulleys operate at the same speed and spin in the same direction, the belt moves between the two. If objects are particularly heavy or bulky — or if the conveyor belt is carrying them for a long distance or
