## What Is Abrasive Blasting? 
17.02.2021Shot blasting may take place in a cabinet, if sufficient pressure is used, or in blast rooms or enclosures. Wheel blasting is used with heavier abrasives, like shot or grit. This method uses a rotating wheel and centrifugal force to propel abrasive media instead of compressed air or water. Wheel blasting was first patented by Wheelabrator in 1932.
