## Operation Of A Grinding Mill
Grinding Operation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics. A mill ready to start a grinding operation could be around 150 t in dead weight. Thus, the initial torque on the mill shaft is very high and an electric drive motor and drive is designed to cope with it. Figure 8.11 illustrates a typical change in torque with increasing speed of motor.

01.12.2006The recommended wheel speeds during dry grinding is in the range of 3000 to 4500 SFPM (15 to 23 m/s). The higher wheel speeds may cause burning of the tool edges. In wet grinding, wheel speeds in the range of 5000 to 6500 SFPM (25 to 33 m/s) provide excellent results. In general, the higher speeds improve both wheel life and metal-removal rates.
