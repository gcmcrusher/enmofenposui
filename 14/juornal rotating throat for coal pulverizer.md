## Rotating throat for coal pulverizer
A rotating throat pulverizing mill has a soft steel vane wheel which rotates with the control bowl for classifying purposes. Wear-resistant vane liners slide onto the vanes to protect the upper surfaces thereof and are held in place, in part, by integral clips which underlie the vane plates and, in part, by wear-resistant cap plates which are welded to a flush upper flange of the vane

## Coal for Electricity Generation 
Most of Kentucky's coal is used to generate electricity. After coal is mined, it is transported to power plants by trains, barges, and trucks. A conveyor belt carries the coal to a pulverizer, where it is ground to the fineness of talcum powder. The powdered coal is then blown into a combustion chamber of a boiler, where it is burned at around
