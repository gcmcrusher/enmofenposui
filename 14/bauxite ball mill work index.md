Working Principle of Ball mill: As the mill rotates, steel balls work to grind the materials. The mill rotates approximately once every couple of seconds. The grinding system uses either 'open circuit' or 'closed circuit'. In an open circuit system, the feed rate of materials is adjusted to achieve the desired fineness of the product. In a closed circuit system, coarse particles are
