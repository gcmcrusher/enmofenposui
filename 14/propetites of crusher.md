## Crusher 
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

Properties of good building stone ; Texture : A good building stones must compose fine crystalline structure which should be free from cavities, cracks or patches of soft or loose material.Stones with such texture are so strong and durable. Toughness Index : If the value of toughness index comes below 13 in impact test, then the stone is not tough.

## Compaction and seepage properties of crushed limestone
Particle crushing during compaction is a main cause of size 0–2.5 mm materials, whereas some fine particles are washed away due to the effect of water seepage, which is a main cause of weight loss. Non-Darcy seepage properties of the crushed limestone are strongly influenced by compaction and particle size distribution.

The resistance to mechanical actions such as impact, crushing and abrasion for the recycled concrete aggregates is also lower. The effects of using recycled concrete aggregates instead of natural aggregates in concrete are: reduction in compressive strength up to 25%; reduction in modulus of elasticity up to 30%; improvement in damping capacity up to 30%; and higher

## WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES OF AGGREGATES FOR CONCRETE?
Engineering Properties of Aggregates. Aggregates are used in concrete to provide economy in the cost of concrete. Aggregates act as filler only. These do not react with cement and water. But there are properties or characteristics of aggregate which influence the properties of resulting concrete mix. These are as follow.

General Outcomes. Smaller is the aggregate impact value, tougher is the material. This is because the fraction that passes through 2.83mm sieve is actually the crushed material that otherwise was a part of aggregate particle/s. More is the fraction finer than this sieve; less tough the material is.
