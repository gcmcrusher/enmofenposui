## Ball Mill Design/Power Calculation 
19.06.2015The approximate horsepower HP of a mill can be calculated from the following equation: HP = (W) (C) (Sin a) (2π) (N)/ 33000. where: W = weight of charge. C = distance of centre of gravity or charge from centre of mill in feet. a = dynamic angle of repose of the charge. N = mill speed in RPM. HP = A x B x C x L.
