## coal mining 
Coal slurry is a mixture of crushed coal and a liquid such as water or oil. The traditional mixture, first patented in England in 1891, consists of 50 percent coal and 50 percent water by weight. So-called heavy coal slurries or slurry fuels consist of 65 to 75 percent coal, with the remainder being water, methanol, or oil.

## Coal Mining 
Coal Mining. Coal fields in Arkansas are located in the Arkansas River Valley between the western border of the state and Russellville (Pope County) an area only about thirty-three miles wide and sixty miles long. Until about 1880, most coal mined in Arkansas was used near its original location, often to fuel the fires of blacksmiths.

About Coal Mines. Most abandoned coal mines are found in the East and tend to be small to medium-sized. Sixty percent of these mines can be found in just three states: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky. Larger sites are found in the West, though in much smaller numbers. Most abandoned coal mines are located on State-owned land.

Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.

Highwall mining is an adaptation of auger mining. Instead of an auger hole, an entry into the coal seam is made by a continuous miner, remotely operated from a cabin at the surface. The cut coal is transported by conveyors behind the miner to the outside. Using a television camera, the operator can see and control the miner's progress.

Coal mining only really began in earnest during the 1600s. The first pits exploited surface outcrops, but by the 1790s, shafts up to 150 m deep were being sunk. The arrival of the railways in the mid to late 1800s caused some expansion, but most of the mines served local markets and could not compete with other coalfields.

## Mine Ventilation 
03/08/2021Ventilation control of dust in coal mines is important in the different types of underground coal mining such as (1) room and pillar mining, (2) longwall mining and (3) shaft mining. Type (1) is done in an ore deposit where some of the ore is left behind to form columns in the mine that prevents it from collapsing and it is used for coal mining

## Research
Coal research has a proud history at Penn State, beginning in the 1890s with establishment of one of the first formal schools of mining engineering in the United States. A lineage of prominent coal scientists has followed over the years, including Walter Maximilian Fuchs, a refugee from Nazi Germany, who developed one of the first molecular models of coal in 1942.

## COAL MINING PROCESS
After the coal was cut, the miner used a wrought-iron hand rake having teeth formed to give a clear opening of 1% in. (4.4 cm.) to separate all the coal smaller than stove from the larger pieces. The rake was used in parts of the coal fields as late as 1850, and perhaps later, for it was
