## Concrete Mix Design Calculator (Based on the ACI Code)
Let us consider the following concrete mix design example: A concrete with a specified compressive strength of 3750 PSI is required for a slab on ground. The slump should be between 3 and 4 inches, and the placement method is by pumping. The exposure conditions following the ACI 318-19 are briefly a follows: S1, F1, W0, and C1.

## CEMENT COMPOSITION 
CEMENT COMPOSITION. Cement composition is the raw material proportion used in the manufacturing of good quality cement comply with IS 8112 : 1998 of 43 grade OPC and IS 469 for 33 grade.. Cement Raw Materials. Cement production mainly consist of Argillaceous and Calcareous raw Material. Argillaceous Materials – silica, alumina and oxides of iron.

Concrete is a breathing material with all its inhomogenous surfaces and cloudy appearances, and we love it as such. Being a hygroscopic material, moisture is absorbed and released from concrete as the surrounding humidity changes. Efflorescence is a specialty of all cement-bonded materials, and is a natural and fully harmless feature of concrete.

## Optimized design of ultra
Its essence is transporting mixture design into mathematic model by determining the relationship between the variables and response [,,, ]. Therefore, when the D-optimal design is utilized in the design of concrete, the limitations from the raw materials (solid or liquid phases) can be effectively mitigated.
