CNC Machining: Basically, these Remote locks are made of metal, therefore CNC machining is the best choice for shaping the outer case of the lock. The spindle of the CNC machine will be guided to the designed locations and depths of the material according to programmed commands. Then, the basic shape of the prototype can be done by the CNC machining.
