## Dense Medium Separation 
rock mining operations has been gaining greater interest. To maximize energy conservation, the pre- concentration process should be conducted at as coarse a crush size as possible while minimizing losses of pay metals. Dense medium separation (DMS) is a robust process that can be conducted at particle sizes as coarse as 300 mm and as fine as 500 m with high

## Artisanal and Small
12.01.2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

12.11.20181- Crushing. The first step in kimberlite ore processing is crushing. This process reduces large run-of-mine lumps into smaller pieces, making them easier to handle, and releases or liberates the diamonds to be recovered in subsequent steps. Crushing is done in stages to "gently" free the diamonds from the kimberlite rock and produce a
