The speed of the grinding section of these mills is usually 75–225 rpm. They operate on the principles of crushing and attrition. Pulverization takes place between two surfaces, one rolling on top of the other.

The hammer mill design is very robust and is used in many applications, from grain milling to heavy duty requirements such as rock crushing or waste grinding. Hammer mills are part of the impact mill family, which means that the milling effect is obtained thanks to the speed at which particles are impacted, here, by one or several rotors. 2.

However, finishing grinding in the cement production process requires accurate temperature control. To achieve this, Vertical Roller Mills burn fuel to heat the mill interior before grinding initiates. In this paper the fuel cost of reheating a vertical roller mill after an evening load reduction event is compared to the electricity saving gained.
