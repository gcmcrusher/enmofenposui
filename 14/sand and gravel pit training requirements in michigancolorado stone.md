## Guidelines for Unconsolidated Non
Unconsolidated non-metallic substance deposits, commonly composed of sand and gravel material, can be measured by volume ( e.g., in cubic metres, m 3) or by weight ( e.g., in metric tonnes, t). Deposit size should be reported by volume when possible, for consistency and can be estimated by multiplying its length, width and depth.
