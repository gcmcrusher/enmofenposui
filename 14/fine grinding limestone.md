Even though stones like granite, marble, travertine, limestone, etc., are hard, they still have a brittle quality as well. Edge polishing, represented by the "bullnose" trim, can be achieved by hand polishers or automatic machines, which can be applied to a large scale of material. The second stage of rock polishing is the fine grind.
