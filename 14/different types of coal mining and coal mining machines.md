Different Kinds Of Coal Mining. Coal is a fossil fuel which is formed by the decomposition and degradation of plant, vegetation and animal life over a period of million of years under the pressure of earth. The energy which we get after burning of these fossil fuels is the same. We provide quality and efficient solutions to our global customers.

Surface mining is used for about 40% of coal production in the world. When coal deposits are near the surface, it may be inexpensive to extract the coal using this method. The different types of surface mining are strip, contour, and mountaintop removal mining. Strip or area mining is most apt for areas with flat terrain.
