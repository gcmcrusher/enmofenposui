Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

## Cement Concrete
In its simplest form, concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates. The paste, composed of portland cement and water, coats the surface of the fine and coarse aggregates. Through a chemical reaction called hydration, the paste hardens and gains strength to form the rock-like mass known as concrete. Within this process lies the key to a

## How concrete is made 
The manufacture of concrete is fairly simple. First, the cement (usually Portland cement) is prepared. Next, the other ingredients—aggregates (such as sand or gravel), admixtures (chemical additives), any necessary fibers, and water—are mixed together with the cement to form concrete. The concrete is then shipped to the work site and placed

## Emissions from the Cement Industry 
Concrete is used globally to build buildings, bridges, roads, runways, sidewalks, and dams. Cement is indispensable for construction activity, so it is tightly linked to the global economy. Its production is growing by 2.5 percent annually, and is expected to rise from 2.55 billion tons in 2006 to 3.7-4.4 billion tons by 2050. Manufacture of Cement

## Cement Production 
Figure 1 describes the cement manufacturing process. It consists of blending, raw meal grinding, pre-calcining, clinker burning and cement grinding. In the crusher, mixing bed, and raw mill, limestone and other materials containing calcium, silicon, aluminums, and iron oxides are crushed, blended, and milled into a raw meal of a certain chemical composition and size

## Quiz on Cement and Manufacture of Cement 
The production process for portland cement first involves grinding limestone or chalk and alumina and silica from shale or clay. The raw materials are proportioned, mixed, and then burned in large rotary kilns at approximately 2500F until partially fused into marble-sized masses known as clinker. After the clinker cools, gypsum is added, and
