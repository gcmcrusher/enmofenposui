## Oil Sands Extraction and Processing 
Currently, 20% of oil sands reserves are accessible via mining techniques. Large shovels scoop the oil sand into trucks which then move it to crushers where the large clumps of earth are processed. Once the oil sand is crushed, hot water is added so it can be pumped to the extraction plant. At the extraction plant more hot water is added to

Oil sands deposits that are greater than 75 meters below the ground surface are usually extracted without removing the overlying rock and dirt. This is known as in situ oil sands mining. Oil sands deposits are usually split into two types of deposits. Shallow deposits are located within approximately 75 meters of the ground surface and are extracted using surface mining methods.

Open-pit diamond mining is used closer to the earth's surface, as miners remove the layers of sand and rock just above the kimberlite rocks. In contrast, underground mining requires the creation of two parallel and vertically connected tunnels where miners in the top tunnel blast the ore of the kimberlite pipes which falls and collects on the bottom tunnel.

## An Assessment of Environmental Impacts of Sand and Gravel Mining 
Sand and gravel mining refers to the actual process of removal of sand or gravel from a place of occurrence. The increase in demand for sand and gravel for construction purposes has placed immense pressure on the environment where these resources occur. Miners employ different methods of extraction along river channels and their flood plains.

## Types of Surface Mining 
In particular, surface mining is used to retrieve sand, gravel, stones, coal, iron and other metals. There are five recognized types of surface mining, each with specific variations depending on the minerals being extracted. These include strip mining, open-pit mining, mountaintop removal, dredging and highwall mining.

## The Environmental Impact of Mining (Different Mining Methods 
Mining can often be devastating — causing water acidification, soil erosion and the degradation of local ecosystems. While some methods have less impact than others, it almost always has a serious and lasting environmental impact. Fortunately, there is some hope that mining will become more sustainable in the future.
