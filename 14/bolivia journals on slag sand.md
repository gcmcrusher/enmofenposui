## Experimental Investigations on Paver Blocks by Partial
Materials such as Cement were replaced by Lead slag in varying percentages from 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% respectively also Natural sand was replaced by 100% M-sand. From test results it was found that optimum content of lead slag that can be replaced is 15% without affecting the strength characteristics of paver blocks.

Home Construction Tips / By happhoadmin7. A concrete mix necessarily contents cement, water, fine aggregate and coarse aggregate. Aggregate occupy about 60 – 70% volume of concrete. In this percentage 40 to 50 % proportion of aggregate is fine aggregate (sand). Fine aggregate selection plays vital role in concrete performance and its cost.

Ground-granulated blast- furnace slag (GGBS): Ground-granulated blast furnace slag is a by-product from the blast furnaces used in the iron manufacturing industry. GGBS is obtained by quenching molten iron slag (a by-product of iron and steel making) in water or steam, to produce granular product i.e. then dried and ground into a fine powder.

The strength development of mortar made from EAF slag has been found to be better than equivalent mortar made with inert sand. EAF slag has also been found to be stable in the presence of moisture. EAF slag are potentially suitable in road stabilization and controlled low-strength fill to reduce the cost of binder.[4]

Therefore, it is recommended that 40 wt% of copper slag can used as replacement of sand in order to obtain HPC with good strength and durability properties. AB - This paper reports on an experimental program to investigate the effect of using copper slag as a replacement of sand on the properties of high performance concrete (HPC).

Firstly, the physical properties of slag, fly ash and sand are tested. Alkali activated slag mortar is mixed with various proportion of activator. And the tests are made eight times with different activator dosage for slag mortar. Then the test is made once again without activator. Water - (slag + cement) ratio of 0.35 is used for this test.

In this work, Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) tests were conducted to study the influence of steel slag on the mechanical characteristics of cement-stabilized sand. The UCS tests were conducted on the compacted specimens which prepared in the laboratory at their Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) and modified Proctor Maximum Dry Density (MDD).
