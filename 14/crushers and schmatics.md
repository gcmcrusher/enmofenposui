## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work 
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing

## Hydraulic and Pneumatic PID Diagrams and Schematics
Pneumatic reservoirs are usually simple tanks and their symbology is usually some variation of the cylinder shown in Figure 20. Hydraulic reservoirs can be much more complex in terms of how the fluid is admitted to and removed from the tank. To convey this information, symbology conventions have been developed. These symbols are in Figure 20.
