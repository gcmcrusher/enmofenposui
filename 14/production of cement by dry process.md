Cement manufacturing process in summary. Portland cement is manufactured by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) with other materials (such as clay) to 1,450 C (2,640 F) in a kiln, in a process known as calcination that liberates a molecule of carbon dioxide from the calcium carbonate to form calcium oxide, or quicklime.

A mixture with an excess of cement paste will be easy to place and will produce a smooth surface; however, the resulting concrete is not cost-effective and can more easily crack. Portland cement's chemistry comes to life in the presence of water. Cement and water form a paste that coats each particle of stone and sand—the aggregates.

What is Portland cement process of Manufacturing,Dry and Wet. The equipment used in the dry process in comparatively smaller. This process is economical than the wet process. The total consumption of coal in the dry process is only about 100 kg, as compared to the requirement of about 350 kg, for producing a tonne of cement in the wet process.

## production of cement by dry process
The development of dry process being only reluctantly implemented in Britain, the industry entered a post-industrial stage of continuous decline. 1973 was the all-time peak year of the UK industry, when a cement production of 20 million tonnes was achieved, the vast majority by energy-inefficient production processes.

## Cement production line
During cement production process, 3 tons of materials at least are needed to be ground to produce one ton of Portland cement. These materials include various raw materials, fuels, clinkers, mixtures and gypsum. According to statistics, over 60% cement plant power will be consumed to grind materials in dry process cement production line.

## Cement Manufacturing Process 
Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

## Cement Manufacturing Process Flow Chart
The process of making cement is described in this flow chart. The two raw materials used in theprocess are limestone and clay. Limestone is crushed, sized, dried and stored in storage silos. In the same way, Clay is washed, crushed, and dried in storage basins. The two materials Production of coins at the mints is a complete process.
