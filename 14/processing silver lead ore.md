## Extraction of Lead 
20.02.2017â€¢ The Parkes process is a pyrometallurgical industrial process for removing silver from lead during the production of bullion. It is an example of liquidâ€“liquid extraction. â€¢ The process takes advantage of two liquid-state properties of zinc. The first is that zinc is immiscible with lead, and the other is that silver is 3000 times more soluble in zinc than it is in lead.

Therefore much lead ore is obtained as a byproduct of other metal mining, usually zinc or silver. Only half of all lead used yearly derives from mining, as half is recovered through recycling, mostly of automobile batteries. Besides the ore itself, only a few raw materials are necessary for the refining of lead. The ore concentrating process
