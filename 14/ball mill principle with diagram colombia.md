3.2 Shaft speed. The 2nd key design and operational aspect for a hammer mill is the rotation speed. As the milling principle is based on the energy of the impact, the higher the speed, the finer the product can be expected as the particles will hit the hammer at high speed, but also be sent against each other or against the screen at high speed.

The Operating Principal. P ulverization takes place in the central chamber of the Micron-Master jet energy mill as the process material is driven at near sonic velocity around the perimeter of the toroidal chamber by multiple jets of air or steam. No grinding media is involved. Size reduction is the result of the high-velocity collisions between particles of the process material itself.

## The Cement Manufacturing Process 
20.08.2015Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay, to a fine powder, called raw meal, which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 C in a cement kiln. In this process, the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are

## Working and Principle of Colloidal Mill : Pharmaguideline
The basic principle used in the colloidal mill is known as rotor-stator which is placed in a cylindrical vessel. The rotor and stator are placed close enough to create a narrow passage where the material to be reduced in size are passed through. That is why the process is known as shearing, because of you literary shear the material into
