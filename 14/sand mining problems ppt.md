07.05.2020Sand mafias are a particular problem in India. In January of this year, 36-year-old Sangeeth Balan was bludgeoned to death with the arm of an earthmover when he resisted a gang of illegal sand miners who arrived at his residential compound with trucks and excavators. Sand mining is regulated in the country, but these regulations are difficult to enforce, and rumours

Common health threats posed by coal mining: Pneumoconiosis, aka black lung disease or CWP, is caused when miners breathe in coal dust and carbon, which harden the lungs. Estimates show that 1,200 people in the US still die from black lung disease annually. The situation in developing countries is even worse.

In Malaysia, main source the of sand is from in-stream mining. In-stream sand mining is common practice becaa use the mining locations are usually near the "markets" or along the transportation route, hence reducing transportation costs. In-stream sand mining can damage private and public properties as well as aquatic habitats.

02.04.2021Skyrocketing tax rates of US-$100 (US-$700) per ton of sand induce only a 1.5 to 2% (respectively, 2.5 to 3%) reduction. There are two explanations. First, taxation of traded sand induces a shift from exports to domestic sales in the exporting countries and, in the case of the import tax, a shift to other importers.
