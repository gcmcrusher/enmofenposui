## Solvent Extraction Method for Edible Oil Processing
Solvent extraction is achieved through the grinding of seed. The ground seed or cake is then purged or washed with a petroleum distillate (the most common chemical used is hexane) which releases the oil in the seed. The solvent is then "flashed off" by heating the oil in a sealed chamber. The oil/solvent blend is next heated to 212 F

## How the Electricity Grid Works 
The electricity grid is a complex and incredibly important system, and one of the most impressive engineering feats of the modern era. It transmits power generated at a variety of facilities and distributes it to end users, often over long distances. It provides electricity to buildings, industrial facilities, schools, and homes.

## Wave Energy 
What is wave energy? Wave energy is an irregular and oscillating low-frequency energy source that can be converted to a 60-Hertz frequency and can then be added to the electric utility grid. The energy in waves comes from the movement of the ocean and the changing heights and speed of the swells. Kinetic energy, the energy of motion, in waves is tremendous. An
