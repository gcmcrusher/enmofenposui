## What is smokeless fuel 
Smokeless fuels can last up to 40% longer than coal, whilst producing 20% less CO2. For example, Homefire smokeless fuel can produce efficiency levels as high as 65% on a multi-fuel stove, which is a large rise from the 28% figure achieved by house coal. Smokeless fuel is more cost efficient than traditional house coal.

## Coal 
Coal supplies about a third of global electricity generation, and until newer technologies are available will continue to play a crucial role in industries such as iron and steel. The IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario envisions that all unabated coal generation ends by 2040. While some 20 countries have set dates to phase out its use for power generation, coal is

This means that you are not permitted to emit smoke from a chimney, unless you're burning an authorised smokeless fuel, or using an exempt appliance. Failure to comply with these rules can result in a fine up to 1000. Typically, smokeless fuels are made with a combination of anthracite, petcoke, and low sulphur coal.
