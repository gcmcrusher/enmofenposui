## Bright future for bauxite industry in Guinea – M i N M E T
16.09.2021The bauxite mining industry is booming in Guinea on the back of demand of Chinese, Russian, Gulf and Indian alumina refineries. The bauxite export from Guinea may exceed to over 110 million tons in 2021. Guinea bauxite is the most preferred ore for alumina refineries worldwide thanks to its low reactive silica content and high gibbsitic alumina.
