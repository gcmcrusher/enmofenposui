This activity describes the average production of sodium carbonate in Germany. The data represent average results for Western European soda production. The sodium carbonate is produced using the Solvay technique. The production process consists of the following steps: 1. brine cleaning, 2. manufacture of the product, 3. lime milk preparation, 4.

## The Slow Carbon Cycle 
Carbon flows between the atmosphere, land, and ocean in a cycle that encompasses nearly all life and sets the thermostat for Earth's climate. The acid dissolves rocks—a process called chemical weathering—and releases calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium ions. In the modern ocean, most of the calcium carbonate is made by shell
