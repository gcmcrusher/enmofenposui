26.03.2021China's crude oil processing also exceeded US gross inputs in both May and October 2020. April 2020 was the first full month for the US in which responses to the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for petroleum products such as gasoline, distillate, and jet fuel. Although net inputs of crude oil to US refiners had seen record declines in April, China's

## kaolin 
kaolin, also called china clay, soft white clay that is an essential ingredient in the manufacture of china and porcelain and is widely used in the making of paper, rubber, paint, and many other products. Kaolin is named after the hill in China (Kao-ling) from which it was mined for centuries. Samples of kaolin were first sent to Europe by a French Jesuit missionary around 1700 as

## China Clay Processing in Cornwall 
Traditionally, china clay is extracted from the kaolinised granite by "wet mining". High pressure jets of water ('monitors') are used to blast the rock faces of the open pits in order to separate the the soft clay from the granite. The resulting mixture of water, kaolin, sand and mica (silicate minerals in forms of sheets) forms a

Kaolin clay, also known as China clay, is an essential industrial mineral primarily made up of the mineral kaolinite – a hydrous aluminum silicate. Kaolin can be found in applications all around us, from consumer products, to advanced industrial processing. Most notably, kaolin is lauded for its use in paper products, both as a filler and as a coating. It is also widely used in refractories

Commercial clays can be added to balance the mix. Commercial ball clay adds plasticity (so it is less apt to crack when bending it). On the other hand, crude ground fireclay, china clay (kaolin) fine sand, and/or grog reduce plasticity (make it less sticky and shrink less).
