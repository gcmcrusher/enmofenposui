19.11.2021To many of course 'coal is coal', and to an extent this is true, at least when viewing the impact on CO2 emissions. In this context one of the four key goals of COP26 – to "accelerate the phase out of coal" – is of course valid. The COP26 statement is clear in intent, but short on detail. Coal was given plenty of attention at COP26.
