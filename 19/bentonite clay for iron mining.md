## Effect of Bentonite on the Pelleting Properties of Iron 
22.06.2017Bentonite solutions have viscous, variable, and lubricant properties. Different types of bentonites influence pellet properties, as well as the interaction among heterogeneous or homogeneous bentonites and iron concentrate [ 3 – 6 ]. In this study, we utilized three different types of bentonites for a pelletizing test.

Green clays are generally from marine life from lakes or inland seas or rivers that the volcanic ash was deposited into. According to Surface Mining, 2nd Edition by B. A. Kennedy, Bentonite is clay consisting essentially of Smectite minerals. The term Smectite is applied as a group or family name and Montmorillonite is a mineral species name.
