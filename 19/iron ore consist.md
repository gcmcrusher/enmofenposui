On the other hand, some types of iron ore consist entirely of ore mineral (magnetite, hematite). The content of metals in different ore minerals depends, in turn, on the ores' chemical composition and varies quite broadly. For example, pyrolusite contains 63.2 percent Mn, whereas rhodonite has 32–41.9 percent Mn.

## Where can I find iron ore? :: 7 Days to Die Questions Answers
10/02/2019Originally posted by FreedomTrucker: Look for those little gravel patches and test dig them. They consist of stone, sand and the ore trace. They will show a trace of the ore that is below it. Most of them will show iron. Keep digging following those gravel blocks through the ground. You can hit huge iron veins easily 10 to 20 blocks down.

## Iron and Steel Industry 
14/12/2006The term iron ore is used when rock is sufficiently rich in iron minerals to be mined economically. Pyrite and pyrrhotite, although plentiful, are rarely used as iron ores because of the high amounts of sulphur they contain. Canadian iron ores consist mostly of hematite or magnetite, and some siderite and ilmenite.

Pure iron is a soft, lustrous, dark silvery-gray metal. Iron is a strongly reactive metal, being very reactive with acids, and forms oxides, commonly known as rust, with air and water. Many reddish or orange colored rocks gain this color from the rusting of iron within the rocks. Iron is a relatively common element in the universe, being found

## Ore 
On the other hand, some types of iron ore consist entirely of ore mineral (magnetite, hematite). The content of metals in different ore minerals depends, in turn, on the ores' chemical composition and varies quite broadly. For example, pyrolusite contains 63.2 percent Mn, whereas rhodonite has 32–41.9 percent Mn.
