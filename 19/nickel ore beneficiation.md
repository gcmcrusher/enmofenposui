## Concentrates and Ore 
An Ore is a naturally occurring material in shape of rock which contains a metal compound. When extracted from the mine ore is typically crushed, ground and run through a beneficiation process to produce enriched ore called Concentrate .One of the most widely used ore beneficiation process is called froth flotation where the minerals are separated from each other.

## What Is Mineral Beneficiation? 
Mineral beneficiation is a process by which valuable constituents of an ore are concentrated by means of a physical separation process. As one of the initial steps of extractive metallurgy, the main purpose is to prepare the ore prior to downstream purification processes. The most common mineral beneficiation processes include: sample
