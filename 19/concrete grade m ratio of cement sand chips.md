## Concrete Mix Ratio and How to Mix Concrete 
Concrete is a mixture of cement, sand (fine aggregate), small stone or gravel (coarse aggregate) and water. It has many applications, from fence posts to motorway bases and, because of this, there are many different concrete mix ratios that the constituents can be mixed to with each resulting in a different strength of concrete. In terms of what different strength

Standard Mix. The nominal concrete mix of a fixed proportion of cement, sand and aggregate provide considerable variation in strength resulting in the poor or over-rich mix. Hence minimum compressive strength has been assigned in many proportions and termed as the standard mix. As per IS 456:2000 Standard Concrete grades are M 25, M 30, M 35, M
