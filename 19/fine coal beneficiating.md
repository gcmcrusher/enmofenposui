## Amenability Testing of Fine Coal Beneficiation Using Laboratory 
The amenability of beneficiating a low rank coal has been studied using a laboratory CPT CoalPro flotation column. After review of the published literature various relationships between bubble size and superficial gas rate, bubble surface area flux and gas hold up and slip velocity and bubble size have been deduced in relation to the coal slurry and compared with

Various methods for the beneficiation of minus 0,5 mm coal are examined briefly, and tests are descriptionbed on a cyclone of 150 mm diameter operating with magnetite as the medium. It was found that, for sharp separations, at least 50 per cent of the magnetite should be finer than 10?m.At that size, the ash content of the product was about 7 per cent at yields of 59 to 64 per
