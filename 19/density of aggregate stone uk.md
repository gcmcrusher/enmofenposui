## Types of Aggregate and Their Uses 
High-Density Aggregate: Used to create very dense and heavy weight concrete mixes that are used mainly for shielding against radiation or for pipeline ballast. Heavy weight natural aggregates such as Baryle, Hermatite, Iron Ore and Magnetite are good examples.

## Aggregate testing 
Aggregates are one of the fundamental materials used in the construction industry. Aggregates can be obtained from a variety of sources: from natural sands and gravels of both land and sea origin to crushed rock and artificially produced materials. They can be used in many ways: as major components of concrete, mortar or bituminous bound materials, as sub-base or capping

Density is also called as unit weight of substance. It is represented by symbol called row ( p). Density represents the degree of compactness of material. If the material is of more density, it is more compacted material. Density is defined as the ratio of mass to volume. p = m/v Units = kg/m 3 or lb/ft 3 Conversion: 1 kg/m 3 = 0.624 lb/ft 3.
