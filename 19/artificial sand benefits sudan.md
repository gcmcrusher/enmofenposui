## What Are The Negative Effects Of Sand Mining? 
13.11.2018By removing too much sediment from rivers, sand mining also leads to the erosion and shrinking of river banks. Deltas can recede due to sand mining. All of these destructive effects of sand mining ultimately lead to the loss of fertile land and property. It also destabilizes the ground and causes the failure of bridges, dikes, and roads.

## The importance of sand dunes to the coastline 
The wind plays a critical role in the life of a beach dune. When it's blowing onshore, it will help accumulate sand where there's an obstacle at the top of a beach - plants, for example. If the wind blows offshore, it transfers sand from the dune down to the beach. Sand Moving Back and Forth. This everlasting replenishment process works naturally.
