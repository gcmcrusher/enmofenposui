Strong magnetic particles may be easily separated with a separator having a low intensity magnetic field of 400 - 600 gauss. Paramagnetic particles (weakly magnetic) require a higher intensity magnetic field to separate them, generally ranging from 6,000 to 20,000 gauss. Particles that are repulsed by a magnetic field are called diamagnetic.
