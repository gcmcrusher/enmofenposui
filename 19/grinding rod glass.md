## Cutting/grinding off small amount glass? 
20.10.2006Just a note of caution: When sanding/grinding glass, be sure to wear a good respirator. Silica dust + lungs = not good. I once had a glass shop increase the four radiused corners of a 30 X 60 X 1/4 safety glass from 5/16 to 5/8, and they used a belt sander. Which is obviously a good tool for the job.

Grinding is a subset of cutting, as grinding is a true metal-cutting process. Each grain of abrasive functions as a microscopic single-point cutting edge (although of high negative rake angle ), and shears a tiny chip that is analogous to what would conventionally be called a cut chip (turning, milling, drilling, tapping, etc.) [citation needed].
