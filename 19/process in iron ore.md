## Understanding water use in mining and mineral processing
Water management in mining and mineral processing. Water is essential to mineral processing. It is used in various steps in the process to recover valuable metals from ore. The water use is quite high – for example, around 1600 litres of water are used to obtain the 19 kilograms of copper found in a medium-sized family car.

## Iron Ore 
Iron Ore. The iron ore fines pass in a downward direction through four reactors where they are heated and reduced to DRI by means of a reduction gas—derived from the gasification of the coal—that flows in the counter-current direction to the ore.

## Iron Ore 
4.1 Introduction. Iron ore sintering and pelletizing are the predominant processes in the iron-making industry [1,2]. During the iron ore sintering process, calcium ferrite phase is believed to be the most desirable bonding phase because it has high reducibility and sufficient mechanical strength [3–5]. The sintering process can be divided

## Sintering: A Step Between Mining Iron Ore and Steelmaking
11.06.2019World resources are estimated to be greater than 800 billion tons of crude ore containing more than 230 billion tons of iron. The only source of primary iron is iron ore, but before all that iron ore can be turned into steel, it must go through the sintering process. Sinter is the primary feed material for making iron and steel in a blast furnace.
