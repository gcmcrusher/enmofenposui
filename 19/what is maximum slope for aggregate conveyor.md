conveyor belt is normally referred to as the carcass. In a sense, the carcass is the heart of the conveyor belt since it must: 1. Provide the tensile strength necessary to move the loaded belt. 2. Absorb the impact of the impinging material being loaded onto the conveyor belt. 3. Provide the bulk and lateral stiffness
