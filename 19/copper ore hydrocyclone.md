## Copper extraction 
All primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being chalcocite), are subjected to smelting.Some vat leach or pressure leach processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting leachate solution, but this is a minor part of the market.. Carbonate concentrates are a relatively minor

## Copper Beneficiation Process 
Copper Flotation. As a commonly used process for copper ore beneficiation, flotation can be used for the separation of copper sulfide and oxidized copper ores. The main process of copper ore flotation is rough as follows: ore crushing and screening → stage grinding stage flotation → concentration and dehydration → copper concentrate.

## Case Studies 
14.10.2021Sometimes the ores are of very difficult treatment, as is the case with complex sulphide ores containing copper, lead, zinc and gold. In these cases the grinding stages must be very fine and consequently the hydrocyclones required in the grinding circuits must be of small diameter, especially in regrind circuits, where sizes up to 12 microns (1200 mesh) must be
