## Flotation Method in Archaeology 
28.02.2019Archaeological flotation is a laboratory technique used to recover tiny artifacts and plant remains from soil samples. Invented in the early 20th century, flotation is today still one of the most common ways to retrieve carbonized plant remains from archaeological contexts. In flotation, the technician places dried soil on a screen of mesh wire

06.07.2017Froth flotation is a process for separating minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their hydrophobicity (how much they are attracted to water) and is enhanced through the use of surfactants. Surfactants are chemicals that act as a wetting agent to attach to particles and increase their attractiveness to air bubbles.
