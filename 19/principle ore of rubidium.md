## dating 
The radioactive decay of rubidium-87 (87Rb) to strontium-87 (87Sr) was the first widely used dating system that utilized the isochron method. Rubidium is a relatively abundant trace element in Earth's crust and can be found in many common rock-forming minerals in which it substitutes for the major element potassium. Because rubidium is concentrated in crustal rocks, the

Twenty four isotopes of rubidium are known. Naturally occurring rubidium is made of two isotopes, 85Rb and 87Rb. Rubidium-87 is present to the extent of 27.85% in natural rubidium and is a beta emitter with a half-life of 4.9 x 10 10 years. Ordinary rubidium is sufficiently radioactive to expose a photographic film in about 30 to 60 days.

## Lithium, Sodium, Potassium, Rubidium, Caesium and Francium
01.01.1997Publisher Summary. This chapter discusses the discovery, isolation, abundance, and distribution of the alkali metals—lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium. The group 1 elements are soft, low-melting metals that crystallize with bcc lattices. All elements are silvery-white except cesium, which is golden yellow in color.

## IMPORTANT ORE MINERALS 
Germanium - A byproduct of zinc ore processing. Also a deposit in China is associated with coal. Gold - The primary mineral of gold is the native metal and electrum (a gold-silver alloy). Some tellurides are also important ore minerals such as calaverite, sylvanite, and petzite. Hafnium - Primary ore mineral is zircon.

## Is rubidium (Rb) more or less reactive in water than sodium?
Answer (1 of 2): You are comparing this reaction: M(s) + H₂O(l) → M⁺(aq) + OH(aq) + H₂(g) for M = Na and Rb, respectively. General rule: Group 1 elements (the so-called alkali metals) become more reactive as one goes down the group itself. This is

The principal series of potassium, rubidium, and cesium in absorption have been measured. The doublet fine-structure has been resolved out to 17p in potassium, to 26p in rubidium, and to 21p in cesium; the doublet fine-structure interval varies in each spectrum inversely as the cube of the effective principal quantum number. In cesium, the doublet intensity ratio, instead of

## Rubidium 
The potassium content of principal cells was, however, significantly lower in rubidium-treated than in potassium-deprived animals. Similar to experiments in which rubidium was given acutely (3 hours), chronic rubidium administration was associated with preferential accumulation of rubidium in all tubule cells relative to potassium.
