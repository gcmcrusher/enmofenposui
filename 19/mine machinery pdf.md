The mine operating on a narrow margin must be prepared to survive periods of depressed metal prices. One tactic to deal with such a situation is to adjust the bound- aries of the area being mined and draw these boundaries at a higher cut-off grade. This will increase the value of the run-of-mine product, and the mine will maintain its profit.
