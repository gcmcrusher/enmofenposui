## Dynamics of Bengal coal mining in the nineteenth century: 
It reveals that though attempted for the first time in 1774, regular excavation of coal mines took off only around the mid-nineteenth century. I argue that mining in Bengal suffered initially from the adverse attitude of colonial governance and its institutions, and afterwards, from the lack of mineralogical knowledge, inefficient transport networks and the scarcity of labour.

Most underground coal is mined by the room and pillar method, where by rooms are cut into the coal bed leaving a series of pillars, or columns of coal, to help support the mine roof and control the flow of air.Generally, rooms are 2,000 feet wide and the pillars up to 300 feet wide.
