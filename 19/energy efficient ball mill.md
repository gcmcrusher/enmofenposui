## A specific energy
A specific energy-based size reduction model for batch grinding ball mills was reported in a previous paper (Shi and Xie, 2015). A discharge function modified from the Whiten classification efficiency equation has been incorporated in the size reduction model to extend its applications from batch grinding to continuous operation.

## Ball Charge and Grinding Efficiency 
What are the dimensions of the ball mill you are looking at? 40% ball charge is quite high (unless you are looking at a small mill). A difference (duty vs. maximum) of 5% to 10% is fairly typical and you would likely struggle to perceive an energy efficiency difference between the two operating points. Beyond this, the situation may change.

Milling was then performed in 80% ethanol for 30–120 minutes using a high-energy ball mill. The mechanical treatment resulted in a reduction of the fibre length and diameter, probably due to degradation of the cellulose amorphous regions. Fibrillation was helped by the wet environment, which facilitated the intra-fibre swelling.
