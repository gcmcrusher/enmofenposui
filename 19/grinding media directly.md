03.07.2021Evan Doran. Associate Editor. On its surface, grinding seems simple: a machine takes a rotating tool (usually a wheel) with abrasive grains and applies it to a workpiece's surface to remove material. Each grain is its own miniature cutting tool, and as grains dull, they tear from the tool and make new, sharp grains prominent.

11/12/2021The breakage and liberation of minerals are the key to fluidized mining for minerals. In the ball milling process, steel balls function as not only a grinding action implementer but also energy carrier to determine the breakage behavior of ores and the production capacity of the mill. When ground products present a much coarse or much fine particle size distribution, the
