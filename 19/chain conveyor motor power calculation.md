## Determining required torque for a chain and sprocket conveyor 
If you plan on driving your conveyor pulley directly by your motor shaft you do not need to consider it. The conveyor belt will always have some belt efficiency so this must be considered and it can be easily looked up. The above equations are mainly used to calculate the torque required by the motor due to frictional forces.
