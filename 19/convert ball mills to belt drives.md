## Plant Engineering 
01.09.2001The problem gradually reduces belt performance by increasing wear and fatigue. Depending on severity, misalignment can destroy a belt in a matter of hours. Sheave misalignment on V-belt drives should not exceed 1/2 deg. or 1/10 -in. of center distance. For synchronous belts it should not exceed 1/4 deg. or 1/16-in. of center distance.

## How to calculate motor drive torque for belt and pulley systems
07.06.2019Tc = torque required during constant velocity (Nm) Fa = total axial force (N) r1 = radius of drive pulley (mm) η = efficiency of belt drive system. Notice that the efficiency (η) of the belt drive system is included in the torque equation. This efficiency accounts for losses such as friction between the belt and pulleys.
