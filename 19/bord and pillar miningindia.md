## Definition of bord
First bords are driven, leaving supporting pillars of coal between. Next, cross drives connect the bords, leaving supporting coal as rectangular pillars. Finally, the pillars are mined (extracted, won, robbed) and the roof is allowed to cave in. The bordroom is the space from which bord coal has been removed.

18.03.2017There are two main methods of extracting coal by underground mining: room-and-pillar (or, bord -and-pillar) and longwall mining. Room-and-pillar minin g involves cutting a network of 'rooms' or panels into the coal seam and leaving behind 'pillars' of coal to support the roof of the mine. Get price .

The underground mining methods we use include room and pillar, narrow vein stoping and large-scale mechanised mining. Room and pillar mining is a style of mining where tunnels are driven in a chess board pattern with massive square pillars between them which are gradually cut away as the work proceeds. We use this for mining coal. Narrow vein stoping is performed in an
