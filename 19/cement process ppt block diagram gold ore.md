## How Gold Is Mined 
Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity – known as dor – typically containing between 60-90% gold.

Methods of Manufacturing Process of Cement. At present Portland Cement is manufactured by two processes, Dry Process, and Wet Process. The main difference between these two methods of manufacturing of cement is that in the dry process, calcareous and argillaceous raw materials are fed into the burning kilns in a perfectly dry state.

## STORAGE, STACKING AND HANDLING PRACTICES
In case cement is received in silos, the silos shall be placed near the concrete batching plan. Proper access shall be provided for the replacement of silos. Different types of cements shall be stacked and stored separately. In similar manner cements in gunny bags, paper bags and polythene sheets shall be stored separately. 2.2.1.2 Lime

## Cement Manufacturing Process 
Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.
