Peel grinding with vit-CBN allowed us to grind up to twenty (20) parts without dressing. This same process was found to be successful for high stock removal applications in hard steel such as 52100 and D2, allowing very short cycle times without burning or cracking the surfaces. We have found that high-speed CBN peel processes grind much cooler

With the dresser mounted to a table, bring the diamond into contact with the grinding wheel near its front corner, feed in a maximum of .002. The wheel is then fed in and out until the necessary amount has been dressed from each side of the wheel.
