All production figures are to some extent guesstimates, but what is certain is that in the period 1500 to 1650

## Impact of alluvial artisanal and small
Alternatively, some small-scale gold miners in Peru and other areas in the world use river dredgers to extract gold directly from the river bed (Mosquera Csar, et al. 2009). Other methods of mining exist in the practice of alluvial mining in the region and are used depending on season and deposit characteristics.
