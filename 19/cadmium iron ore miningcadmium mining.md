## Cadmium Toxicity: Where is Cadmium Found? 
Cadmium, a rare but widely dispersed element, is found naturally in the environment. Most cadmium ore (greenockite): occurs in association with zinc. It is released into the environment through mining and smelting, its use in various industrial processes, and enters the food chain from uptake by plants from contaminated soil or water.

## Cadmium 
Cadmium is a resource. Cadmium (Cd) is a resource. It can be found on planets orbiting Class K/M systems (red stars). A chromatic metal, generated by fusion in the heart of a star. Such stellar material ends up forming deposits in the crust of local planets. Cadmium is found on planets orbiting red stars, and can be placed in a Refiner to create purified Chromatic Metal for use in
