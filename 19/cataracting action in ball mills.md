## Development of operation strategies for variable speed ball mills
Optimum ball mill operating conditions can be determined based on circuit design and operating dynamics for any given run-of-mine ore. Mineral processing productivity relates to a range of operating parameters, including production rate, product grind size, and energy efficiency. Variations in ore properties and operating conditions change the comminution dynamics,

## cataracting effect in ball mill
Aug 08, 2018 There are two well-known modes in which the ball charge moves inside the mill: cascading and cataracting. The cascading motion of ball charge forms a compressive zone inside the mill where particles may break under slow compression. The cataracting motion, on the other hand, causes the particles to break under high-impact forces.

milling action has changed considerably as the liner wears. Not only has the impact point dropped down onto the charge, but there is clearly a smaller fraction of the charge undergoing cataracting and impacting. The consequence of this is a shift from impact breakage to abrasion grinding. This will result in a lowered throughput, but finer

Conical Ball Mills differ in mill body construction, which is composed of two cones and a short cylindrical part located between them (Fig. 2.12).Such a ball mill body is expedient because efficiency is appreciably increased. Peripheral velocity along the conical drum scales down in the direction from the cylindrical part to the discharge outlet; the helix angle of balls is decreased
