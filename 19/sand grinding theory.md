## Grinding (abrasive cutting) 
Grinding is a subset of cutting, as grinding is a true metal-cutting process. Each grain of abrasive functions as a microscopic single-point cutting edge (although of high negative rake angle ), and shears a tiny chip that is analogous to what would conventionally be called a cut chip (turning, milling, drilling, tapping, etc.) [citation needed].

## Energy Use of Fine Grinding in Mineral Processing 
18.12.2013Fine grinding, to P80 sizes as low as 7 μm, is becoming increasingly important as mines treat ores with smaller liberation sizes. This grinding is typically done using stirred mills such as the Isamill or Stirred Media Detritor. While fine grinding consumes less energy than primary grinding, it can still account for a substantial part of a mill's energy budget. Overall
