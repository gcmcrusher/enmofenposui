01.09.2020All over the world, pelletization (a form of agglomeration of iron ore fines) studies of both hematite and magnetite iron ore were mostly conducted using either high-grade ore from the mines or the beneficiated concentrate from the processing plants. To evaluate the quality of indurated pellet for its end use in the iron-making process, characterization such as CCS,

## Dry processing of magnetic iron ores 
IMP Technologies (IMPTEC) has anticipated the need for a dry low cost processing alternative which can open the way for the development of lower grade magnetite deposits and ensure the sustainability of processing in Australia. The lower grade magnetite deposits are generally fine grained and require grinding to p80's of 30 to 40 microns.

## Iron ore mining process and iron ore mining equipments
Iron ore is beneficiated by crushing and then separating the iron from the gangue minerals through screening. This is usually so efficient that lower grade ore can be treated especially when the magnetite is quite coarse. Common iron ore crushers are jaw crusher, cone crusher and fine jaw crusher. Dry magnetic separation and wet magnetic separation
