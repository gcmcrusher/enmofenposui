28.02.2016The charge is heated slowly until boiling point of mercury is reached. At this point the mercury is eliminated and condensed in cooling tubes passed through water. Obviously, some losses can be produced and this can be estimated as 0.065 grams per 255 grams of mercury. The process takes two to three hours.

## Why can't we convert salt water into drinking water?
Kim Westerskov/ Getty Images. It seems strange that water should be such a scarce resource when our planet is drenched in 326 million trillion gallons of the stuff. But it turns out that less than one-half of 1 percent of it is drinkable. Out of the rest, 98 percent is oceanic salt water and 1.5 percent remains locked up in icecaps and glaciers.

## How to refine gold without hydrochloric acid 
Answer (1 of 3): Well, you can melt it and bubble chlorine gas through it. This converts most of its impurities to either volatile chlorides or chloride slag. Or you can hammer it flat, and leach it with nitric acid. This is good for parting gold from silver. Or, you can electrorefine it by dis

When 4-12 hours has passed, drain or siphon off the clear water (salt water), and refill the bottle with distilled or good drinking water. (You may keep this water, adding more distilled to it and raising the pH to get more precipitate.) Shake it and let it settle again. This is called "washing the precipitate". Wash the precipitate at least 3 times with clean water, each time shaking it

## About Salt 
Salt, the essence of the sea, that body of water that all life came from, comes from the residue of lost oceans and seas (as is the case in the sea-aquifer from which Khoisan Trading obtains its richly mineralised brine); and from the evaporating edges of living ones. Medical and scientific studies condemning table salt examine only refined

## The Gold Smelting Process 
18.01.2017This is a chlorination process that refines gold to a purity of about 99.5%. The process involves blowing chlorine bubbles through molten gold which reacts with metallic impurities forming a chloride slag that is separate from pure gold and floats on top. Gold produced here is then cast into bars ready for the market.
