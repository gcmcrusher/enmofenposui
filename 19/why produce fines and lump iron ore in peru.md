Key facts. In 2020, Canada was the eighth-largest producer of iron ore in the world. Canada's iron ore is mined in Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut. The top three iron ore-producing countries (Australia, Brazil and China) accounted for 69% of global production. The primary use of iron ore is to make steel, which is 100% recyclable.

DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state, i.e. without melting, as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen, coming from reformed natural gas, syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

## High coking coal prices provide glimpse into steelmaking's future
25.01.2022Higher-priced coking coal is likely to affect the steel industry's transition to greener production methods as well as the value-based pricing of iron ore. Higher-priced coking coal increases the cost of producing steel via blast furnaces, both in absolute terms and relative to other routes. This typically leads to higher steel prices as raw
