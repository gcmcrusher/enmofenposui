## Which mineral might scratch the mineral fluorite? 
Answer (1 of 5): A mineral or other material with a higher hardness number can scratch anything with an equal or lower number. Thus, a copper penny can scratch calcite, gypsum and talc, while a fingernail can scratch only gypsum and talc. A piece of quartz can scratch fluorite but it

## Fluorite 
Fluorite (also called fluorspar) is the mineral form of calcium fluoride, CaF 2.It belongs to the halide minerals.It crystallizes in isometric cubic habit, although octahedral and more complex isometric forms are not uncommon.. The Mohs scale of mineral hardness, based on scratch hardness comparison, defines value 4 as fluorite.. Pure fluorite is colourless and transparent,

## Fluorite 
When fluorite occurs as a cavity fill in carbonate rocks it is usually associated with calcite, dolomite, anhydrite, gypsum and sulfur. In hydrothermal vein deposits, fluorite may be found with calcite, dolomite, barite, galena, sphalerite, and even silver ores. In Our Society: The Economic Importance of Fluorite. The name 'fluorite' comes from the Latin word 'fluere' that
