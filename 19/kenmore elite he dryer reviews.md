## Kenmore Elite 31633 washer review 
27.09.2018The Kenmore Elite 31633 is a large-capacity, top-load washer that works well for big families. It includes 11 wash cycles, five soil levels and several wash-and-rinse temperatures. This washer is designed to use less water than most agitator-type machines, so it costs less, on average, to operate each year. The matching dryer, the Kenmore 61633

10.06.2017Kenmore review: kenmore series 100 washer dryer. Worst washer dryer I have ever owned. The washer doesn't get cloths clean, barely agitates and doesn't fill with enough water even on deep cycle. The dryer doesn't even get cloths dry after 60 minutes. I have been so disappointed with these products.
