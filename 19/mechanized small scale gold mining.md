By artisanal mining, it is meant, small-scale mining involving the extraction of minerals with the simplest of tools, on a subsistence level. In some countries, a distinction is made between 'artisanal mining' that is purely manual and on a very small-scale, and 'small-scale mining' that is more mechanised and on a large scale.

Alluvial gold is found beneath the surface at the bottom of a creak or stream. Alluvial gold mining is the process of extracting gold from these creaks, rivers and streams and is generally considered to be the most environmentally friendly method of gold mining as a result of the reduced environmental impact when compared to underground mining.

12.01.2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.
