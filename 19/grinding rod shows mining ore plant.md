## Conventional grinding process 
16.09.2020Because the ore to be ground passes through the grinding machine only once, the product size is relatively coarse. This type of process is commonly used in the first stage of the single-stage rod milling process or the first stage of the two-stage grinding process with rod mills. The ore can be ground from 20-25 mm to about 3 mm at a time.

## Using Rock Geomechanical Characteristics to Estimate Bond 
28.10.2021A Bond rod mill work index test (BRMWI) is a standard test for determining the rod mill work index of an ore sample [21]. The BRMWI is a measure of the resistance of the material to crushing and grinding in a rod mill and is used to calculate the grinding power needed for a given material parcel regarding rod mill grinding conditions.
