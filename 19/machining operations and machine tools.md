## 13.4 MACHINING PROCESSES AND MACHINE TOOLS
Regardless of the type of machining operation, some basic types of chips or combinations of these are found in practice (Fig. 13.4.4). Continuous chipsare formed by continuous deformation of the work-piece material ahead of the tool, followed by smooth flow of the chip along the tool face. These chips ordinarily are obtained in cutting duc-tile materials at high speeds. Fig.

## What are the different types of Machining Operations?
Turning Operation. Turning is a type of machining operation used to remove material from the outer diameter of a cylindrical workpiece. The workpiece is held in a chuck rotating at high speed during turning operation. A single-point cutting tool is fixed to the machine, and it moves in X and Y directions to cut the material.

1.2 Uses of Lathe Machines: The lathe is a machine tool used principally for shaping articles of metal, wood, or other material. All lathes, except the vertical turret type, have one thing in common for all usual machining operations; the work piece is held and rotated around a horizontal axis while being formed to size and shape by a cutting

## Machining Processes Explained 
Therefore, during the Machine Age, machining referred to (what we today might call) the traditional machining processes, such as turning, boring, drilling, milling, broaching, sawing, shaping, planning, reaming, and tapping. In these traditional or conventional machining processes, machine tools, such as lathes, milling machines, drill
