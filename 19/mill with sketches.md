## Face Milling vs Peripheral Milling: What's the Difference?
19.04.2019When compared to face milling, peripheral milling is more effective at removing large amounts of material from workpieces. This is because it uses the sides of the milling cutter rather than the tip. With face milling, only the tip of the cutter is exposed to the workpiece. While this fine for certain milling applications — particularly those that require a minimal amount of
