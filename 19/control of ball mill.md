## Ball End Mills 
Fast-Cutting Carbide Ball End Mills. Variable spacing between the flutes reduces vibration, allowing these end mills to provide fast cuts, smooth finishes, and long tool life. Made of solid carbide, they are harder, stronger, and more wear resistant than high-speed steel and cobalt steel for the longest life and best finish on hard material.

Dynamic experiments were performed in a continuous open-circuit 4040-cm ball mill using a pseudorandom binary sequence of the feed rate and measuring the variations of the discharge particle-size distribution. The impulse response is calculated by a cross-correlation technique. Then a model involving a discrete transfer function and a time-series stochastic equation is

## Optimized control for ball mill powder making 
This paper introduces an optimized control plan for ball mill powder making, in which, the ball mill is running in the steady state and the steady state control mode is realized in three levels, i.e.: fuzzy circuit control, decoupling coefficient control and target optimization. Our tests show that the optimized control plan ensures the powder making system can be running steadily
