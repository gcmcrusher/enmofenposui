 Introduction to Mineral Processing 2 1.0 Introduction 1.1 Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy Mineral processing is a major division in the science of Extractive Metallurgy. Extractive metallurgy has been defined as the science and art of extracting metals from their ores, refining them and preparing them for use.

## Mineral Processing 
Mineral processing, mineral beneficiation, or upgradation involves handling three primary types of ROM material, which have been blasted, fragmented, and brought out from an in situ position. These materials can be used directly or by simple or complex processing and even by applying extractive metallurgy like hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical methods.

Mineral beneficiation is the process of concentration, and was first described in Agricola's famous treatise, De Re Metallica, published in 1556. The earliest ores to be discovered and processed were of such high grade that they did not require beneficiation, and they satisfied mankind's needs for nearly 3,000 years. By the end of the
