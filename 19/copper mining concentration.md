## Copper Environmental Profile 
copper mining: surface and underground mining. Due to copper being spread in relatively low concentrations over large areas, surface, or open-pit mining, is the predominant mining method for copper in the world. After mining, copper is produced by one of two process routes: pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical.

## Mining Process 
Since inception of the mine, refractory ore from the copper production process was surface stockpiled. KCM has now developed a process to extract copper from the refractory ore stockpile. The company also produces several by-products, including sulphuric acid produced from the smelting process, which is largely consumed in the leaching process.

## Dissolved Copper Concentrations 
Dissolved copper concentrations in the riverine systems around Ok Tedi mine are at levels which are of ecological, but not of human health concern. The dissolved copper concentration risk has decreased since 2008 due to lower ore cut-off copper grade from the waste rock dumps and decreased copper from tailings as a result of improved recoveries
