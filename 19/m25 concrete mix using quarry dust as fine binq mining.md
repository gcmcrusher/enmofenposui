## High Performance Concrete using Quarry dust as Fine aggregate
mining, quarry dust was used as fine aggregate. Quarry dust is the fine material, produced from gravel crushers. Super plasticizers were used to improve workability of concrete. Cement was replaced with 10% of silica fume. The M60 grade concrete used was designed by using a modified ACI method suggested by Atcin. Volume fraction of the fibres
