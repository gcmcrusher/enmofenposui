Abstract. The effect of dry grinding of kaolin minerals by a mechanical mortar was examined by x-ray, thermal, and electron microscopic methods. Base exchange capacity and apparent density were also measured. In the early stage of grinding, kaolin crystals cleave and fracture and then split into fine crystals which are considered unit crystallites.

## The effects of the fine grinding on the physicochemical prop
The processes involved have been widely studied, especially for kaolinite. 1–4 Dry grinding causes a decrease in the degree of crystallinity of kaolinite crystals, leading to the formation of reactive surfaces or changes in the physicochemical behavior. With respect to bentonite, Kller etal.5 studied grinding in a ball mill, under dry and

## Dry and Wet Grinding Effect on Kaolinite and Its Zeolite Formation 
ABSTRACT. Dry and wet grinding effects of kaolinite on the formation of zeolite Na-A and Na-X in NaOH solution are fundamentally investigated. Intensive dry grinding causes the structural deformation of kaolinite into an amorphous state with enhanced chemical reactivity.

of studies has been conducted construing the effect of grinding on the structure of kaolinite for a better understanding of its structural behavior change [10]. At first, the dry grinding of kaolinite was found to result in the reduction of its particle size due to the cleavage and fracturing of the kaolinite crystal [11-13].

## Grinding of kaolinite processing 
The effect of grinding on the structure of kaolinite has been known for some time (1-4). The effect of grinding of soils containing kaolinite has also been elucidated (5). This effect influences the cation exchange capacity of the soil (6). In the 1960's the grinding of kaolinite was thought to produce a zeolite-like material
