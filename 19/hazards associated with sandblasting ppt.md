Silicosis - When workers inhale crystalline silica, the lung develops scar tissue around the silica particles. This process results in a lung disease known as silicosis. As more lung tissue is damaged by silica dust, breathing becomes more difficult, chest pain occurs, and death may result. Silicosis patients suffer shortness of breath, fever
