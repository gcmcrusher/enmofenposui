Each grain is its own miniature cutting tool, and as grains dull, they tear from the tool and make new, sharp grains prominent.

18.06.2021The last part of the wheel spec that severity of operation helps us determine is the grade of the bond or hardness of the wheel. Where we have heavier pressure, we naturally go with a harder grade for the wheel because we want the wheel to hold up under the forces of the grind operation - to hold on to the grain long enough for it to do the work we need it to do.
