## How Gold Is Mined 
Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity – known as dor – typically containing between 60-90% gold.

## Cyanide
A commerative gold ingot from the first gold pour using our cyanide-free recovery method. The infrastructure for a processing plant that uses cyanidation typically costs $30 million, and is therefore, a barrier to entry for gold miners with smaller deposits that do not fit into the large-scale economies of gold production.

03.03.2009We estimate that artisanal and small scale gold mining releases between 640 to 1350 Mg of mercury per annum into the environment, averaging 1000 Mg yr -1, from at least 70 countries. 350 Mg yr -1 of this are directly emitted to the atmosphere while the remainder (650 Mg yr -1) are released into the hydrosphere (rivers, lakes, soils, tailings).

01.10.2009Gold processing is typically offered to miners for free or a token fee, if miners agree to leave tailings at the Centers. These Centers rarely recover more than 30% of the gold brought by the miners. The residual gold left in the Centers is then extracted by cyanidation from the mercury contaminated tailings. A key issue in this scenario, is that cyanide dissolves not
