## Prediction of soil erosion from waste dumps of opencast mines 
The volume of mine waste rock generated, including tailings from mineral processing activities, is one of the main pollution concerns in the mining industry in general. In the State of Goa (India), the waste rock management is becoming increasingly difficult due to acute space shortage consequent to expanding mining activities.

Nov 01, 1993The environmental costs which often accompany opencast coal mining are generally excluded from financial appraisals of opencast projects. We examine an opencast proposal for the North Staffordshire coalfield of the UK. A survey of local estate agents suggests that, as measured by the impact upon local house prices, the monetary environmental

Studies recognise that opencast coal resources essentially lie throughout lowland Clackmannanshire, with the exception of the western area around Tullibody and Menstrie. There is no opencast potential north of The Ochil Fault, which runs along the line of the Hillfoot settlements. The coal seams that do exist are of varying thickness and qualities.

## Environmental effects of mining 
Environmental effects of mining can occur at local, regional, and global scales through direct and indirect mining practices. The effects can result in erosion, sinkholes, loss of biodiversity, or the contamination of soil, groundwater, and surface water by the chemicals emitted from mining processes. These processes also affect the atmosphere from the emissions of carbon which
