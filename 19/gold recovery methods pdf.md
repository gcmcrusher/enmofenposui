## Gold Recovery Methods 
The methods used for the recovery of gold consist of the following unit operations: Gravity Concentration methods are systems which use gold's high density to capture the precious metal. Gravity based equipment includes jiggs, spirals, sluices and tables. Gravity systems are often the lowest cost system, but only a certain part of the gold is usually coarse enough to be

Amalgamated gold recovery is an ancient and universal method for gold extraction. Since the gold is mostly free in ores, some gold grains in all ores can be recovered by amalgamation. It has been proved that using the amalgamation method to recover some gold particles in advance can obviously reduce the loss of coarse gold in tailings. 2.
