01.01.2012Amines are widely used for flotation of sylvite (KCl) from halite (NaCl) and insoluble materials such as clays. Amine collector is also absorbed by clays. Therefore, clays are usually separated by scrubbing and de-sliming prior to flotation. Alternatively, slimes can be floated ahead of potash flotation. Flotation recoveries of sylvite are commonly in the range of 85%,

Flotation is one of the main concentration processes to purify kaolin clay via the removal of naturally occurring impurity minerals containing Ti and Fe. Currently, there are two types of collector chemistries used in the industry to float coloured impurity minerals. These are traditional tall oil fatty acids (TOFA) and specialty hydroxamate (AHX) based collectors.

## Role of Montmorillonite, Kaolinite, or Illite in Pyrite Flotation 
It is widely acknowledged that clay minerals have detrimental effects on the process of flotation, but the mechanisms involved are still not fully understood. In this work, the effects of montmorillonite, kaolinite, and illite on pyrite flotation were investigated from the perspective of various structures of clay minerals. Flotation tests suggested that the detrimental effect of

Dec 16, 2021In the flotation experiments, better results were obtained in terms of chalcopyrite grade at a low airflow rate and a high froth height. With increasing froth height there was a decline in the gangue mineral recovery as the residence time of the froth increased. The most significant factor increasing pyrite recovery was the amount of clay.

The ability of solid particles to stabilize emulsions has been reported for more than one century by Pickering (Pickering, 1907) and Ramsden (Ramsden, 1903).Natural minerals such as clays were then rapidly employed as solid stabilizers for many different applications (Jiang et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2021).Their success in Pickering emulsion

Dec 16, 2021Clay minerals are the main gangue minerals in these ores causing difficulties in the flotation of valuable minerals (Ndlovu et al., Reference Ndlovu, Farrokhpay and Bradshaw 2013). At present, no reliable methods are available to diminish the detrimental effects of clay minerals, particularly in the flotation of gold and copper ores.

Clay minerals occurring in nature, including kaolin clays, frequently contain discoloring contaminants in the form of iron and/or titanium-based impurities. The quantities of these titaniferrous impurities in sedimentary kaolins of Georgia are significant and are commonly present as iron oxide-stained titanium oxides.
