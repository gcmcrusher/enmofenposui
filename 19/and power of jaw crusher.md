25.12.2014The crushing power of the jaw crushers depends on the size of the chamber. The bigger the chamber, the more powerful the jaw crusher. The crushing process can be basically explained as a process where the materials are sandwiched between two jaw plates. The movable jaw plates squeeze and crush the materials into several small pieces. There are two
