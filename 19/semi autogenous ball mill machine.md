## autogenous sag mills
Autogenous Mill Diameter Ton Kwh campel. SAG is an acronym for Semi-Autogenous Grinding. SAG mills are autogenous mills but use grinding balls like a ball mill. A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder. SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%. The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter, powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor

Rely on our proven track record of SAG and AG Mill superiority. Since the early 1980s, we have been designing and manufacturing Semi-Autogenous (SAG) and Autogenous (AG) Grinding Mills under the Fuller-Traylor brand. Semi-autogenous grinding uses a minimal ball charge in the range of 6-15% while autogenous grinding uses ore only.

## SAG Mill 
Single stage SAG Mills are very beneficial in reducing CAPEX for plants with a staged throughput approach. When future tonnage is to be increased, the SAG Mill can feed downstream ball milling to boost capacity. Fuller-Traylor SAG/AG Mills range in size from 4.3m through 12.2m in diameter with powers as high as 28,000 kW.
