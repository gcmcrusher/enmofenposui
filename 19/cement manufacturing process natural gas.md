## Natural gas dependence and risks to activity in the euro area
It is the most important source of energy in the manufacturing sector, and more than 90% of the gas consumed in the euro area is imported. The euro area is heavily dependent on imports of both petroleum-based energy products and natural gas, while renewable energy and nuclear energy are predominantly domestically produced (Chart A, panel a).

The manufacturing process is highly energy-intensive, and regulated emissions, particularly of carbon dioxide and sulfur oxides, must be carefully monitored. We offer a comprehensive range of gas analysis and emissions detection options for these manufacturing processes – including options for high particulate levels.

In fact, the cement industry alone accounts for around 7% of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the world. Mexico is the 11th largest cement producing country in the world producing 51 million tonne (Mt) of cement in 2021. Around 87 % of the energy used in Mexico's cement industry is fossil fuels dominated by petroleum coke, natural gas and coal.

15.07.2022Most of the fuels used in the cement manufacturing process, such as natural gas, coal and petroleum coke, emit planet-warming gases. Unlike other industries, the cement industry cannot rely on most renewable energy sources to power its operations due to the extremely high temperatures that are needed for production.
