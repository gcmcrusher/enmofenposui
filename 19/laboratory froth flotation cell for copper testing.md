where Coo is the concentration of the mineral in the flotation cell, even after a long flotation time. The flotation rate equation is used to predict flotation recovery, grade of concentrate, and separation efficiency as functions of flotation time. The predicted values of these quantities are in agreement with the experimental values.

Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.

The flotation experiments were performed in a 0.5 L mineral separator (MS) type laboratory flotation cell to upgrade recoveries of Cu and Ni (bulk flotation) from mine tailing. In flotation tests, an appropriate weight of the mine tailing sample was poured into 500 mL of water to prepare slurry/feed with different pulp densities from 10% to 25%.
