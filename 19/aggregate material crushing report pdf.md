Natural sands and gravels are the product of weathering and the action of wind or water, while manufactured crushed fine aggregate and crushed stone coarse and fine aggregate are produced by crushing natural stone.

Crushed stone is produced by crushing quarry rock, boul-ders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Crushed air-cooled blast-furnace slag is also used as fine or coarse aggregate. The aggregates are usually washed and graded at the pit or plant. Some variation in the type, quality, cleanli-ness, grading, moisture content, and other properties is expected.

Samples of aggregate for bituminous mixtures are submitted to the State Materials Laboratory for determination of a mix design. These samples must be representative of the average grading of separate materials produced and information concerning the proportions of coarse and fine aggregates produced shall be included in the letter of transmittal.

Crushed aggregate usually produced by crushing quarry rock or large-size gravel. • The quality of aggregate are important to produce a good concrete mix. The aggregates need to be clean, hard, strong particles free of absorbed chemicals or coatings of clay and other fine materials that could cause the deterioration of concrete.

The aggregate crushing value is a value which indicates the ability of an aggregate to resist crushing. The lower a figure the stronger the aggregates that is the greater its ability to resist crushing. 2.1 THEORY Granular base layers and surfacing are subjected to repeated loadings from truck tires and the stress at the contact points of aggregate particles can be quite high.
