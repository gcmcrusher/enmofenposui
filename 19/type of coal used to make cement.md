Coal is by far Canada's most abundant fossil fuel, with 6.6 billion tonnes of recoverable coal reserves. Canada has anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal deposits. More than 90% of Canada's coal deposits are located in western provinces, which provides a strategic advantage because of the close proximity of west coast ports.
