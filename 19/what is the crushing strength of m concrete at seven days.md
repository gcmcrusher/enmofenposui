## Concrete Cube Testing Explained 
17.01.2020A concrete cube test involves taking a sample of freshly mixed concrete, letting it cure, then crushing it and measuring its compressive strength. Many concrete suppliers carry out this process at a certified test house, away from their facilities. At Rapid Readymix, we conduct all our cube tests in-house, as we have a state-of-the-art testing

Jul 12, 2017 Concrete strength varies with time, and the specified concrete strength is usually that strength that occurs 28 days after the placing of concrete. A typical strength–time curve for normal stone concrete is shown in Figure 2. Generally, concrete attains approximately 70% of its 28-day strength in 7 days and approximately 85% to 90% in 14 days.

## Everything You Need to Know About Concrete Strength 
31.03.2019While traditional concrete normally has a compressive strength ranging anywhere from 2,500 to 5,000 psi, UHPC can have a compressive strength of up to 10 times that of traditional concrete. After just 14 days of curing, UHPC has a compressive strength of 20,000 psi. This number increases to 30,000 psi when fully cured for 28 days.

## Low 7
25.06.2005But as Ron wrote, your best bet for strengths between 50 and 60% at 7 days is the use of slag cement or fly ash. Check the mix design. If you have 3, 7 and 14 day breaks you can plot strength Vs time and estimate from the curve the projected 28 days strength. 50% after 7 days does sound a little low.

Twenty eight days is a long wait to determine if desired strengths are going to be obtained, so three-day and seven-day strengths can be useful to predict the ultimate 28-day compressive strength of the concrete. A 25% strength gain between 7 and 28 days is often observed with 100% OPC (ordinary Portland cement) mixtures, and between 25% and 40% strength gain
