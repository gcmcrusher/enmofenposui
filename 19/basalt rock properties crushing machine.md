01.11.2020Abstract. In this study, the basalt rock extracted from the Kalgoorlie region of Western Australia is intensively studied on its compressive properties under both static and dynamic loads covering strain rate between 2.22 10 -6 /s to 408/s. The ultimate compressive strength and corresponding failure strain are quantified.
