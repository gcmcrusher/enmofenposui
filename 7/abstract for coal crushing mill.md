## Dynamic Analysis on Hammer of a Coal
Download PDF Abstract. The Paper deals with the Static and Dynamic (Modal, Harmonic) analyses for analyzing the hammer used for crushing coal. The size of the coal received is 200 mm and has to be crushed as per the desired sizes (30mm) . The hammers are made of Manganese Steel (SA – 105). Deformation under static analysis is found.

## Crushing and screening circuits 
For conventional grinding circuits using ball mills or combinations of rod and ball mills, secondary, tertiary and even quaternary crushing stages are normally required.Older type crushers such as stamp mills, double rolls, sledging mills and hammermills are no longer common but are used for small tonnage special processes.Important to efficient crushing are

## Investigation on the Coal
11.02.2020Abstract The feasibility of producing direct reduced iron from pellets made up of mill scale by utilizing coal as a reductant has been investigated. The chemical and morphological characterization studies reveal that the mill scale contains around 71% Fe and comprises of a mixture of iron oxide phases such as magnetite and hematite with a little amount of wustite.

## Dynamic Analysis on Hammer of a Coal
Abstract The Paper deals with the Static and Dynamic (Modal, Harmonic) analyses for analyzing the hammer used for crushing coal. The size of the coal received is 200 mm and has to be crushed as per the desired sizes (30mm) . The hammers are made of Manganese Steel (SA – 105). Deformation under static analysis is found.
