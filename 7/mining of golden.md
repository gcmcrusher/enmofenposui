## The outbreak of illegal gold mining in the Brazilian Amazon 
The types of gold mining in Brazil are twofold: (i) industrial mining, which are required to have a lease permit, and (ii) small-scale (seldom artisanal) mining, known as garimpos, where simplified forms of exploration, extraction, processing, and transportation are used (OECD 2016; Sousa et al. 2011). Several garimpos use heavy machinery to extract gold

Mining today. Gold helped make New Zealand's economy successful because it attracted people, investments and shipping. Because the price of gold was fixed, gold mining declined in the mid-20th century, but revived in the 1980s when the price was allowed to float.
