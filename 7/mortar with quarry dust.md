## mortar using quarry dust
It is interesting to note that at 28days quarry dust mortar had slightly higher strength as compared to 1:1:1.5 CLSP mortar. However at 56day the compressive strength of 1:1:1.5 CLSP is much greater than that of mortar using Quarry Dust. This can be attributed to the lower hydration rate of .
