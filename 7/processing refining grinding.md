For refining, gold bearing alloys are processed on different methods, depending on their carat content. Two methods are commonly employed for purification: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process. Alternatively, it can be a complex mix of burning, drying, grinding, screening, blending and sampling for low-grade scrap and floor sweepings.
