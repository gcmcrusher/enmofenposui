Copper is the most popular commodity (after uranium) that is mined by ISR (Table 1). There are references to primitive forms of in situ leaching of copper in Roman times, and maybe even long before that in China (O'Gorman et al., 2004). The San Manuel copper mine in Arizona is the best known copper mine exploited by ISR (O'Gorman et al., 2004).

The American Geosciences web site defines four main mining methods: underground, open surface (pit), placer, and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.

Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper. These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so valuable. Bioleaching and phytomining are increasingly used to extract copper from low grade ores (see below). The traditional method of extraction is to heat the copper sulfide.

## Uranium Mining and Extraction from Ore 
Uranium Extraction. Uranium leaching is the process by which the uranium is extracted from the raw ore by reacting the material with acid or base. Fig. 2 shows a general process flow for the uranium extraction process. Prior to the leaching process, the ore is often given preliminary treatments that can include roasting and grinding.

## How digital innovation can improve mining productivity
01.11.2015We believe that the mining industry is at an inflection point, in which digital technologies have the potential to unlock new ways of managing variability and enhancing productivity. The large-scale adoption of four different clusters of technologies is accelerating 2: Data, computational power, and connectivity.

Copper is the most popular commodity (after uranium) that is mined by ISR (Table 1). There are references to primitive forms of in situ leaching of copper in Roman times, and maybe even long before that in China (O'Gorman et al., 2004). The San Manuel copper mine in Arizona is the best known copper mine exploited by ISR (O'Gorman et al., 2004).

Cut-and-Fill Mining. A method of short-hole mining, cut-and-fill mining is used in irregular or steeply dipping ore zones, especially where the hanging wall limits the use of long-held methods. The ore is mined either in slightly inclined or horizontal slices

The main series of dates from Rudna Glava indicate that mining to produce copper metal was underway by 5400–5300 bc, and continued at a low level in the following centuries. The mining intensified in the early fifth millennium bc in the so-called Gradac phase of the Vinča culture, finally ending around 4700–4600 bc.
