## Magnetizing Reduction and Magnetic Separation Studies on Low
Magnetic separation is most used to separate natural magnetic iron ore (magnetite) from a variety of less magnetic or nonmagnetic material [7]. Magnetizing reduction is one of the most effective unit operations in the treatment of low-grade iron ores specially those which are poorly responsive to conventional beneficiation techniques such as froth flotation, gravity separation

## Types of Iron Ore: Hematite vs. Magnetite 
04.01.2016Types of iron ore: Magnetite. With the chemical formula Fe3O4, magnetite ore has much lower iron content than hematite ore. That means it has to be concentrated before it can be used to produce steel. However, the ore's magnetic properties help separate magnetite ore from rock during concentration. Magnetite ore is currently mined in

## Why we use hematite over magnetite as iron ore? 
Answer (1 of 6): Because hematite can be easily reduced to iron by converting it into magnetite then wustite and later iron. The hematite can be easily oxidized and it contain abudant amount of iron. magnetite can't reduced easily
