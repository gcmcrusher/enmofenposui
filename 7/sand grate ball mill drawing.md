Dec 26, 2012A grate assembly at the discharge en d of the mill permits retention of a higher ball charge (up to 50%) than is possible in an overflow mill which has a practical limit of around 40%. Behind the grates is a lifting compartment which picks up the ground material as it passes through the grates and transports it out of the mill.

## Ball mill 
A ball mill, a type of grinder, is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores, chemicals, ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including ceramic balls, flint pebbles, and stainless steel balls.
