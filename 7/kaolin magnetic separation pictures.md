Magnetic separation was performed for 2.5 minutes retention timewith a total cycle time of 10 min. The kaolin was then chemically leached with 2-6 pounds/ton of sodium hydrosulfite (Na 2 S 2 O 4) to remove soluble discolored impurities (i.e. iron oxide) from clay. For Sample 10, all the dispersants were present during the blunging.
