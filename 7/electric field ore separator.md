So the electric field due to q1 points to the left, that of q2, points to the right. As the field due to q2 is of greater magnitude, the net electric field

## Different types of separation methods for minerals
This separation can be done either physically, via gravity separation, electrostatic separation and magnetic separation, or chemically, using froth flotation, leaching, and electro winning. Unusable minerals, which are often discarded into dams, are called tailing. In order to understand the benefits of dry mineral processing, you must first

As for poor ore grade of 45% so they are temporarily stored on the floor of the mine. In this work, there is provided a study of the electrical properties of iron ore in view of electrostatic separation.

## Edison and Ore Refining 
12.04.2017Edison planned to process 1200 tons of iron ore every twenty hours. The plant had three magnetic separators that could produce a total of 530 tons of refined ore. There was other equipment to re-refine what was left over to extract even more ore. But technical problems persisted. Iron ore rock crushers used in Edison's iron ore refining business.

With preconcentration there are customers who can double the grade of their material. The STEINERT XSS T EVO 5.0 with 'dual energy' x-ray transmission (XRT) is ideally suited for ore sorting because the x-ray radiation can penetrate stones with particle sizes up to 100 mm. Metals can thus be detected, even when they are not on the surface.

By definition, the potential difference between point B and A is equal to work done in moving unit positive charge from A to B. So, Δ V = E → ⋅ Δ r → = E Δ r cos 180 0 = − E Δ r.
