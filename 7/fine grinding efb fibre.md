## Plant Fibers 
Harvested from a number of plants, these fibers are useful for a surprising number of things. Plant Fibers are a resource gathered by using a sickle on Grass, Bullrush, Sagebrush, Heliconia, King Fern or Filmy Fern. Filmy Fern can also be gathered without the use of a tool. They are mainly used to make clothing, mortar and a variety of furniture.

## Fibre Discs 
Here's why: fibre discs are made of a single layer of precisely oriented abrasive grains on a stiff vulcanized fibre backing. The entire face of the disc is covered in grains, increasing the cutting surface area. This allows the cutting teeth to "bite" into the metal and remove material more quickly than a depressed center grinding wheel.
