## Part One Introduction and Summary 
Copper is a reddish or salmon-pink metallic element. In ore, the copper usually is linked with sulfur (sulfide ores) or oxygen (oxide ores). Ores also contain other metals, including valuablebyproduct met-als (e.g., gold, silver, and molybdenum), and large quantities of valueless rock. Ore typically contains from 0.4 percent to 6 percent copper.
