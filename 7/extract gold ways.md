## gold processing 
Such ores are referred to as refractory, and they frequently contain the sulfide minerals pyrite, pyrrhotite, or arsenopyrite. Gold can be freed from these ores or concentrates by treating them with various oxidizing processes. The most common method is to roast gold-bearing minerals at temperatures of 450 to 750 C (840 to 1,380 F) to
