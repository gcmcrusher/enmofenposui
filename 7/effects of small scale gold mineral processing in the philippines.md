## Positive and Negative Effects of Mining
Mankind started mining for precious metals between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago. For the last century, mining has been one of our planet's largest industries (it generated 683 billion dollars in revenue in 2018 alone). This only underscores the fact that our desire for precious metals and minerals has grown exponentially since we first started digging through the topsoil

This process is mostly used in large scale mining operations but has been increasingly adopted in small scale mining because of its high gold recovery rate and low cost. The best practices for chemical leaching are a combination of pre-concentration and mill leaching, as they lead to the least amount of waste, a short processing time for miners, and high gold
