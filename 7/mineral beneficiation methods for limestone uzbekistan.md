Limestone can be categorized as either high calcium or dolomitic. Pure high-calcium limestone is 100 percent calcium carbonate (100 percent calcite or aragonite). Generally, limestone of this purity does not occur naturally. High-quality, high-calcium limestone would actually contain 97 to 99 percent calcium carbonate and 1 to 3 percent impurities.

Many beneficiation techniques can be employed to upgrade the P2O5 grade of phosphate ores based on their characteristics in chemical composition and texture. The flotation process is most widely applied to balance the P2O5 recovery ratio and cost. In this review, the dominant techniques for the beneficiation of phosphate ores are introduced.
