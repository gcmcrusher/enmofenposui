End mills are made out of either cobalt steel alloys (known as high speed steel, or HSS), or from tungsten carbide in a cobalt lattice (shortened to carbide). High Speed Steel (HSS): Provides good wear resistance and costs less than cobalt or carbide end mills. HSS is used for general purpose milling of both ferrous and non-ferrous materials.
