The specific energy values used were obtained from testwork and are 6. kWh/t for the SAG mill and 9.2 kWh/t for the ball mills. The total charge volume ranges between 20–25% by volume in the SAG mill and 25–34% by volume in the ball mill. The ball charge volume is adjusted according to the demand and operation of the mill.
