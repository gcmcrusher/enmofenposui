Sub-base material layers tend to be placed deeper within a pavement where loading is less, and as such the quality of the materials within sub-bases may not need to be premium. Significant fines and plasticity (plastic fines) may also be incorporated to assist in the binding nature of the sub-base material required during placement.

## Bulk
Flowable base bulk-fill composites seem most suitable for narrow cavities deeper than 4 mm, in particular when a higher adaptation potential thanks to better flowability in less accessible cavity configurations is desirable. In more extensive cavities, full-body bulk-fill composites with a high filler load are preferable.

## Subbase (pavement) 
In highway engineering, subbase is the layer of aggregate material laid on the subgrade, on which the base course layer is located. It may be omitted when there will be only foot traffic on the pavement, but it is necessary for surfaces used by vehicles. Subbase is often the main load-bearing layer of the pavement.Its role is to spread the load evenly over the subgrade.
