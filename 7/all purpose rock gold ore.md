Perform a simple test of the material in the pan to assess whether it is real gold. Raw gold appears brassy yellow and bright. If you think it is gold, place your hand between it and the sun to create shade over the gold. If it still appears bright in the pan, chances are that it is real gold.

Crushing the ore can free the gold and allow recovery by gravity-based methods. In fact it's very common that the gold in hard rock ores will range in the 30- to 200-mesh size range with most of the gold in the lower end of that range. The tried and true method for testing these ores in the field is hand crushing and panning.
