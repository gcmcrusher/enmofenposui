## Efficiently optimise ore sorting • STEINERT
With preconcentration there are customers who can double the grade of their material. The STEINERT XSS T EVO 5.0 with 'dual energy' x-ray transmission (XRT) is ideally suited for ore sorting because the x-ray radiation can penetrate stones with particle sizes up to 100 mm. Metals can thus be detected, even when they are not on the surface.

Lesson 5.1: Introduction to the Cycle of Operations. The process of exploitation reduces to two fundamental operations: winning, i.e., freeing the ore from the orebody, although that term is rarely used in ordinary conversation; and materials handling, i.e., transporting the ore to the mineral processing plant.Winning and handling are repeated over and over again, i.e., they

## Opportunities for Improvement: an Introduction to Ore Sorting
05.04.2022Ore sorting is regularly highlighted as a technology of real merit and long-term potential for a mining industry tasked with efficiently processing progressively lower grade ore bodies. In this blog, I'm going to take a look at the sensing technology at the heart of ore sorting, and at how implementation positively impacts mining operations.

## ANCIENT MINING 
Once broken up, the ore had to be brought to the surface for further processing. Diodorus [3.13.1] mentions boys scrambling through the tunnels, and Pliny [XXXIII 71] describes a relay of miners carrying the ore out on their shoulders. Figure 3, the Greek plaque, shows smaller individuals handling the ore baskets.
