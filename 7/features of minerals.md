## THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS
Hydrous Minerals. Minerals containing water in their structure are known as hydrous minerals. The hydrous mineral Gypsum has a chemical formula of CaSO 4 2H 2 O. The large number 2 in front of the H 2 O signifies that there are two water (H 2 O) molecules for every molecule of CaSO 4.The dot in between CaSO 4 and 2H 2 O indicates that these are two separate

2.3 Mineral Groups Most minerals are made up of a cation (a positively charged ion) or several cations and an anion (a negatively charged ion (e.g., S 2–)) or an anion complex (e.g., SO 4 2–). For example, in the mineral hematite (Fe 2 O 3), the cation is Fe 3 + (iron) and the anion is O 2– (oxygen). We group minerals into classes on the basis of their predominant anion or anion

It would be nice if every mineral had their own special test that we could name after them such as the Fluorite Test for example. But they usually don't, so we must catalog all the results of several known physical property tests and hope that a collector can find enough positive (or diagnostically negative) results out of these to identify an unknown mineral.

## Types of Minerals 
Oxides: When an ore is found in which one or more elements are combined with oxygen, it is an oxide mineral. These may have chemical formulas of the type XO (MgO, ZnO, CuO, etc.), X 2 O (Cu 2 O), X 2 O 3 (Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3), XO 2 (MnO 2, SnO 2) and XY 2 O 4 (MgAl 2 O 4, FeCr 2 O 4).The oxide minerals are mostly of metallic elements. Example: hematite, magnetite, and

01.04.2021Abstract This paper addresses for the first time the internal structure of lens 2 of the Shulepovo refractory clay deposit. The SEM study of representative samples from the entire lens section revealed relationships between the major minerals: kaolinite, halloysite, illite, and quartz. The lens was previously considered homogeneous, but its detailed study revealed a clear

## Quartz: Mineral information, data and localities. 
The structure of quartz was deciphered by Bragg and Gibbs in 1925 (for a review of the structure and symmetry features of quartz, see Heaney, 1994). Quartz as a rock-forming mineral, in particular as irregular grains in the matrix, occasionally poses problems and may require additional means of identification.
