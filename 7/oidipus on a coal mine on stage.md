Investments in export-oriented coal mining projects are under consideration in a number of countries. They are at various stages in the development process and here are classified as "more-advanced" and "less-advanced"1. More-advanced projects under development represent about 93 Mtpa of coal mining capacity, of which about 69% are for metallurgical (met) coal

While underground mining, which allows coal companies to extract deeper deposits of coal, is viewed as less destructive than strip mining, the effects of mining widespread damage to the environment. In room-and-pillar mines, columns of coal are left to support the ground above during the initial mining process, then they are often taken out and the mine is left to collapse,

The Byerwen Mine is located 20 kilometres west of Glenden in Queensland's Bowen Basin. Once operational the Byerwen Mine will produce up to 10 million tonnes of hard coking coal per year. Coal from the Byerwen Mine is railed to Abbot Point Coal Terminal for export. Byerwen Coal was granted the mining leases required for the project in May 2017.

## Coal mining 
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is

## Coal mining 
In room-and-pillar mining, coal deposits are mined by cutting a network of 'rooms' into the coal seam and leaving behind 'pillars' of coal to support the roof of the mine. These pillars can be up to 40% of the total coal in the seam – although this coal can sometimes be recovered at a later stage. Longwall. When is this method used?

Particular focus is placed on coal mining in the Mpumalanga Province, which accounts for over 84% of South Africa's coal production. This was done with a view to developing a better understanding of the interrelationships between the coal mining industry and the local environment and society in which it operates.
