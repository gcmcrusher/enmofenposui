Olson offers a wide range of geophysical methods for investigating geologic and manmade subsurface conditions. Geophysics is generally used in collaboration with other geologic, geotechnical, or environmental site data to provide details between, below, and beyond available drill hole data. Subsurface imaging can provide information on soil and

Incorrect prediction of the rock-mass quality can lead to economic problems for the quarry. By performing geophysical measurements a more complete understanding of the subsurface geology can be determined. This study shows that by doing 2D-parallel data sampling a 3D inversion of the dataset is possible, which greatly enhances the visualization

## Geophysics and Remote Sensing 
Geophysics offers a window into the earth and delivers cost-effective benefits. GTA's Geologists and Geophysicists use physical properties (i.e., gravity, electricity, density, magnetic, electromagnetic, etc.) to remotely sense into the subsurface of the earth. Geophysical techniques are known as "non-invasive, non-destructive" techniques because they rarely require that the
