## What Is Conveyor System?
02.10.2021A conveyor system is a fast and efficient mechanical handling apparatus for automatically transporting loads and materials within an area. A conveyor system may use a belt, wheels, rollers, or a chain to transport objects. A conveyor system is a common piece of mechanical handling equipment that moves materials from one location to another.

## Handling Conveyor Chain / Sprocket Maintenance and Inspection
How to measure chain length. With long-term use, wear to chain pins and bushes causes the chain to lengthen, so that it runs poorly on the sprockets. Therefore, the guideline for replacement is when pitch extension reaches 2~3% of the standard dimension. Measure chain length across four or more links, as shown in the diagram on the right.

## Determining required torque for a chain and sprocket conveyor 
If you plan on driving your conveyor pulley directly by your motor shaft you do not need to consider it. The conveyor belt will always have some belt efficiency so this must be considered and it can be easily looked up. The above equations are mainly used to calculate the torque required by the motor due to frictional forces.

## Maximizing pellet quality during load
• Chain conveyor/flight conveyor • Screw conveyor The preference with regard to maximizing pellet quality during load-out and delivery is to use dosing grid slides, as then the damage to the pellets during transport is the smallest. This is because there is a continuous dosed discharge which minimizes the pressure in the product.
