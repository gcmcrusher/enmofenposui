Electromechanical Vibratory Feeders: These types of feeders create vibration by rotating eccentric weights using electric motors. They are also referred to as eccentric-mass mechanical feeders. A simple design consists of a single rotating eccentric mass. However, the more common is the use of two counter-rotating masses.
