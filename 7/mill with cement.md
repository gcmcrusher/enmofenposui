Raw Materials of Cement. Most important raw materials (what is cement made of) required in the manufacture of Portland Cement are: Limestone, Clay, Gypsum, Fuel, and Water (in wet method). 1. Limestones: These are sedimentary, calcium carbonate rocks (CaC0 3 ). Most commonly they contain a small amount of magnesium carbonate also.
