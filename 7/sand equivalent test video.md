## Prefabricated Vertical Drains 
31/03/2014Fellenius (1977) suggested that the equivalent cylindrical diameter of a sand drain is the nominal diameter of the sand drain multiplied by the porosity of the sand in the drain [2]. The porosity of loose, free-draining sand can range from 0.4 to 0.5. They ran tests on four different PVD specimens that varied in properties (including mass
