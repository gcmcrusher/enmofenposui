## Bases and Subbases 
The moisture content of foundry sand is also important during the construction phase. The presence of the bentonite clay tends to increase the optimum water content of foundry green sands compared to regular sand, so additional water may be needed to keep the sand at theoptimum water content to maintain high density.

## Can waste foundry sand fully replace structural concrete sand?
Foundry sand (FS) waste creates a serious solid waste management problem worldwide due to the high volumes produced, necessitating alternatives to landfilling. A possible route is its use in concrete; however, the current consensus is that FS can only be used for modest sand replacements, based mostly on evidence on concrete with clay-bound FS

## Foundry Casting Industry 
A foundry or metal factory casts metals into shapes by melting them down and pouring the molten liquid into a sand, ceramic or metal mould to form geometrically complex parts. The metal is then allowed to cool and the liquid solidifies. The shaped metal, or casting, can now be used to produce more difficult and uniquely shaped products or parts.
