Since CWF contains 60-70% of finely dispersed 42250 μm coal particles, its production occurs in special mills. Traditional coal slurry production involves ball and bar wet mills with average power costs of 86 to 248 kWh per ton. The high power costs are due to the low efficiency of these units, which are are also quite cumbersome.
