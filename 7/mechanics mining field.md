## Rock mechanics and mining engineering 
Abstract. The engineering mechanics problem posed in all structural design is the prediction of the performance of the structure under the loads imposed on it during its prescribed functional operation. The subject of engineering rock mechanics, as applied in mining engineering practice, is concerned with the application of the principles of

## Mining 
Mining is the extraction of minerals or other materials that are found on various planets, moons, and asteroids to be sold for profit. Mining is done primarily with ship-mounted mining equipment, or with hand-held mining tools; and can be done in open space, on a planet/moon, or underground. Minerals that can be obtained through mining include both productive and
