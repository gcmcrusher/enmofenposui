## HIGH
High-Feed Milling Mechanism First utilized in the die and mold industry, high-feed milling is a machining method that pairs shallow depth of cut (DOC) with high feed rate up to 2.0 mm per tooth. This combination maximizes the amount of metal being removed from a part and increases the number of finished parts in a given time.

When one end wears out, switch to the opposite end for two times the life of a standard carbide end mill. Made of solid carbide, these end mills are harder, stronger, and more wear resistant than high-speed steel and cobalt steel for the longest life and best finish on hard material. Use them to round sharp corners on the edge of your workpiece.

## 6 Reasons To Choose High
Increasing cutting velocity will only lower the temperature to a small degree. This transition is what signifies HSM. For example, when milling aluminum at m/min, the temperatures may reach degrees. However, if we increase the velocity up to 1200, the temperature goes down to less than 200 degrees, and it is a mere 150 degrees
