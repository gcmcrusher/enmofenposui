24.08.2018Located approximately 150km from Bamako City, the project consists of 295km of land hosting high-grade lithium pegmatites. "The Goulamina lithium project is estimated to contain ore reserves of 31.2Mt grading 1.56% Li 2 O.". The deposit falls within a series of vertical spodumene-rich pegmatites, which trend in north-north-west direction.
