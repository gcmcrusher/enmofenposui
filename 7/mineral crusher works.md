## Crusher 
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Crushing Mineral Processing
16.01.2016In mineral processing, the reduction of minerals by crushing and grinding may be regarded as having one or other of two main objectives: The basic principle upon which a crusher works is the application of the necessary force in a suitable way to overcome bonding forces by which a lump of mineral is held together.

Features Benefits. A Cone Crusher will deliver a 4:1 to 6:1 reduction ratio. As we set the closed side setting tighter to create a finer output, we also reduce the volume or throughput capacity of the machine. Generally speaking, multiplying the closed side setting by two is a good guide to the top size of the gradation exiting the machine.
