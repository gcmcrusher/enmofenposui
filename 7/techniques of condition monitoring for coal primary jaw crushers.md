Primary Crusher - an overview ScienceDirect Topics. Primary coal crusher: Used for larger coal size. The primary coal crushers may be of different types such as: (1) coal jaw, (2) coal hammer, and (3) ring granulator. Secondary coal crusher: Used when the coal coming from the supplier is large enough to be handled by a single crusher.

## Assessment of emission
01.07.2021The PM 10 concentration over a region is unknown due to the limited number of monitoring stations revealing only pointwise measurements especially at real operating conditions of coal crushers. It is therefore prudent to model PM 10 emissions ( Singh et al., 2011 ) and dispersion over a region ( Pisoni et al., 2009 ) to develop effective emission control
