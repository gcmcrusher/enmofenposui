The rotary kiln provides constant mixing of the pellets, bringing all the pellets to the same temperature. In a straight grate, the pellets at the top of the bed are "over cooked" and those at the bottom are "under cooked". Higher quality means fewer fines, better reducibility and less variation in compression strength.

01.01.2015Hematite and magnetite are the most prominent iron ores. Most of the high-grade hematite iron ores (direct shipping ore (DSO)) are subjected to simple dry processes of beneficiation to meet size requirements. This involves multistage crushing and screening to obtain lump (− 31.5 + 6.3 mm) and fines (approximately − 6.3 mm) products.

14.03.2018Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing. This step prevents overloading the crusher and increases its efficiency.
