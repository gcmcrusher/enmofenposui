Acanthite is the most important silver ore next to galena.Actually there is an argument to be made that acanthite could be the most important silver ore. Galena is a lead ore that often contains enough silver (usually about 1%) that when it is processed for its lead content the by-product silver supplies the majority of the world's needs. But most, if not all the silver in

A vein deposit is sometimes referred to as a (metalliferous) lode deposit.

ADR Circuit. The most common way to recover gold and silver dissolved from the ore in the leaching process is the use of an Adsorption/Desorption/Recovery circuit commonly referred to as ADR circuit. In this circuit, activated carbon, typically made from coconut shell, is used to recover the gold and silver ions from the slurry.

Altos silver-gold ore contains 3.5 g/t Au and ~90 g/t Ag. Sulphide content in the ore is low. Gold and silver are recovered by cyanide leaching (see the following section for details). During the cyanide leaching, gold was recovered efficiently (residues ranged from 0.02 to 0.15 g/t Au), but silver recovery was much lower than expected
