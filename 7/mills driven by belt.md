30.08.2010I have got the belts out of my Kondia FV-1 mill, the back gear timing belt looks OK but the main drive plain V-belt looks worn. The labelling on the belt is not legible. The printed Kondia Manual I got with the mill does not list the belt type. The Bridgeport Manual I got off the web lists the belt as a Gilmer 4LS 345.

Each year, over two million tonnes of cement are produced there. One of the largest and most modern stone crushers in the world is driven by wrapped V-belts from Optibelt. The crushing system uses 68 Optibelt S=C Plus 8V sections in lengths of 5230 to 13,280 mm. They ensure that Cementa can crush 2,000 tons of stones per hour.

## Why is a belt
Answer (1 of 2): A belt system has some benefits: 1. Multiple grinding machines can be operated from a motor take off shaft (i.e. only one prime mover is required) 2. The speed of the machine can be adjusted by changing the size of the pulleys.

## Difference Between Gear Drive and Belt Drive
26.11.2018Moreover, it is always kept under full lubrication. Thus gear drive provides high efficiency, usually above 99%. On the other hand, belt drive is one friction drive and has surface contact between pulley and belt (lower pair). Loss of power due to friction results lower efficiency in belt drive (around 92 – 96%).

## Gear drive vs belt drive mill : Skookum 
For a home-gamer, the belt drive is a safety feature. You're not going to need the torque a gear driven machine can put out. If you goof and get something stuck, the belt will slip. If you get a gear driven machine stuck, then you're going to strip some gears. You can still work with tougher materials, you just have to take your time with them.

Aluminium plate 138mm x 70mm x 6mm thick, 8mm probably a better choice. 2 x 27.4mm x 25mm OD standoffs, used the riser from casting the pulleys.
