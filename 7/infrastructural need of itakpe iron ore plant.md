This has to be beneficiated at a rate of 8 million tonnes per year to produce 64% Fe concentrate as sinter material for the Ajaoukuta blast furnace and 68% Fe concentrate as pellet feed for the direct reduction plant at Aladja, in Nigeria.

The slope stability of the Itakpe Iron Ore Mine has been carried out using computer software ROCKPACK III. One hundred and twenty three dip and dip direction values were obtained using compass clinometer. The Itakpe Iron Ore Mine was divided into four benches 241258 m 263275 m 276286 m and 308312 m.
