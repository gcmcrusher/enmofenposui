A type of gyratory crusher often used for primary crushing. It has a fixed spindle; i.e., the spindle is not suspended from above, but is mounted in a long eccentric sleeve. Rotation of the sleeve imparts a gyratory motion to the crushing head, but gives a parallel stroke; i.e., the axis of the spindle describes a cylinder rather than a cone as in the suspended spindle gyratory.
