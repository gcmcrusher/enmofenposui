## Copper Ion Recovery from Mine Water by Ion Flotation
21.06.2016Solutions containing copper ions are produced at copper mines due to its dissolution from ores and dumps. It is important to recover these ions to prevent this toxic element from entering the environment and because it could be economical.

## copper iron flotation in south africa 
Sep 14, 2013 The copper is separated from the iron by methods used to refine copper-sulfide ores (many of which also contain iron). Copper-sulfide ores are first treated by a process called flotation. In this process, bubbles are produced in a mixture of ground copper ore, water, and chemical reagents.

## Development of copper recovery process from flotation tailings 
15.06.20181. Introduction. Copper is one of the most important base metals and widely used as wire and conductors. In the earth's crust, copper is most commonly present as copper‒iron‒sulfide and copper‒sulfide minerals, such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and chalcocite (Cu 2 S) [1,2].About 80% of the world's copper ores originate in Cu‒Fe‒S minerals,

01.02.2008DATC's are more selective for copper sulfide flotation, particularly against gangue iron sulfides. Although less powerful than xanthates, DATCs can perform copper/iron flotation separation at lower operating pH (commonly at pH levels below 11.5). ECTCs use an ethoxycarbonyl replacing an alkylN-substituent in DATCs.
