## USGS: Statistics and Information: Bismuth 
Bismuth is mainly a byproduct of lead ore processing. It has a metallic luster and is silver-white with an iridescent tarnish. Among the heavy metals, it is the heaviest and the only non-toxic. Bismuth has been used in solders, a variety of other alloys, metallurgical additives, medications, and in atomic research.

## Bismuth(III) oxide 
Bismuth(III) oxide is perhaps the most industrially important compound of bismuth.It is also a common starting point for bismuth chemistry. It is found naturally as the mineral bismite (monoclinic) and sphaerobismoite (tetragonal, much more rare), but it is usually obtained as a by-product of the smelting of copper and lead ores. Dibismuth trioxide is commonly used to

## Bismuth 
Bismuth. Bismuth is a brittle, crystalline metal that is white with a pinkish tint. It is the heaviest and only nontoxic member of the heavy metals . Its name is derived from the German Wismut (white metal), which was Latinized to bisemutum by G. Bauer in 1530. In early years it was confused with tin and lead.
