Workholding is the generic term for any device used to firmly hold your workpiece while machining it. Closely related terms are "jigs" and "fixtures.". A fixture holds your workpiece while it is being cut. A jig holds the workpiece and also guides the cutter. Given CNC, there's little need for jigs as the g-code guides the cutter, so
