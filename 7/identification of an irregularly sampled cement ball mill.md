A continuous-time stochastic model is considered for describing fading channels from irregularly sampled data affected by measurement noise. The model parameters are estimated using an instrumental variable approach that gives consistent estimates as the number of data tends to infinity and the upper bound on the irregular sampling interval tends to zero.

A 10 MW cement mill, output 270 tonnes per hour. A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.
