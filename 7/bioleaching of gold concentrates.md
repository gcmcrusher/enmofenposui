01.07.1997Abstract. Bioleaching is a simple and effective technology for metal extraction from low-grade ores and mineral concentrates. Metal recovery from sulfide minerals is based on the activity of chemolithotrophic bacteria, mainly Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and T. thiooxidans, which convert insoluble metal sulfides into soluble metal sulfates.

Bioleaching Test Procedure - Mineral Processing Metallurgy. Jun 15, 2018 The results showed that bioleaching had markedly increased the extraction recovery of gold and silver compared with direct cyanidation of the pyrite concentrate without bioleaching. The latter approach achieved only 32% and 48% recovery of gold and silver respectively.

## Effect of Ag+ on Bioleaching of Arsenic
Abstract: The effect of Ag+ on bioleaching of As-bearing gold concentrate was studied. The concentrations of Fe3+, Ag+ and As in the bioleaching solution were monitored during the leaching process. The effect of Ag+ on the bacterial density was investigated and the leaching residue was characterized by XRD and SEM.

FIELD: chemistry. SUBSTANCE: selective oxidation of minerals: pyrite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, and antimonite. Bioleaching is controlled by the oxidation-reduction potential of the biopulp while continuously determining the mineralogical composition of the flotation concentrate fed for food, determining the content of the latter arsenopyrite and antimonite and the pyrrhotite/pyrite ratio.
