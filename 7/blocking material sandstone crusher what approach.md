## CASE STUDY 
Two pieces of information are needed to compute the SRI of a material: solar reflectance and thermal emittance. Solar reflectance, or albedo, is the ability of a material to reflect—rather than absorb—energy emitted from the sun. This parameter is measured on a scale from zero to one with values approaching one as reflectance increases.

Sandstone has two major applications, as crushed stone and as dimension stone. Dimension stone is any rock material that is cut into specific sizes, typically as blocks and slabs. Crushed stone is used in the construction of roadways and road structures such as bridges, and in buildings, both commercial and residential.

09.06.2020Firstly, the size of relatively bigger sandstone blocks was reduced using a sledgehammer, and smaller blocks with a volume of 600–900 cm 3 were crushed by a Blake-type jaw crusher. By sieving the crushed rock blocks, rock aggregates with different size fractions (e.g., sizes I–III in Fig. 7e) were prepared for each rock type.

09.05.2013Polymeric sand, or "poly-sand" seemed great at first. As easy to install as regular sand, almost. You simply sweep the material into the flagstone (or other paver) joints, lightly hose down, then it solidifies. Once it dries and hardens, the sand stays in place.

## Numerical simulation of particle migration from crushed sandstones 
15.01.2019The crushed sandstone was made up of different-sized particles, which are aggregated by the additional cohesive force. The groundwater occurs, and generates certain pressure on the crushed sandstone from one side, as shown in Fig. 1. The water flushes into the sample with a constant flow pressure.

16.12.2020Suppose a 7000 tpd mine would need a 4860 Blake type jaw crushing 500 tph of minus 6 inch product. Such a crusher would cost perhaps $350,000 including significant installation costs. An equivalent portable crusher system might involve five machines, four of which would be in service, with each capable of 250 tph.

Principles. The sub-base layer is often the main load-bearing layer of a pavement. It is designed to evenly spread the load of the paving, and any traffic thereon, to the sub-grade below. A well-constructed sub-base will aid drainage and prevent settlement and channelisation - the phenomenon common on cheap installations of block paving, where
