## Cobalt Ore 
This chapter describes copper and cobalt ore deposits in the Copperbelt region of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. It indicates how high-purity cobalt and copper are made from these deposits and suggests how the deposits will be exploited as mining moves down into the sulfide layer. The copper and cobalt ores are found in a 500

## Cobalt 
Cobalt is a chemical element with the symbol Co and atomic number 27. As with nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron.The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal.. Cobalt-based blue pigments (cobalt blue) have been used since
