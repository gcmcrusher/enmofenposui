James G. Speight PhD, DSC, in Asphalt Materials Science and Technology, 2016 5.9.5 Bulk Specific Gravity. The bulk specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a given volume of aggregate, including the permeable and impermeable voids in the particles, to the weight of an equal volume of water (Kandhal et al., 2000; Prowell and Baker, 2004; Sholar et al., 2005).
