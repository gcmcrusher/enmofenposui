## Conveyor Belt Slipping and Alignment 
There is more than one reason for conveyor belt slippage, so it must be learned what the reason is. However, the most important thing is to get the band out of the existing alignment and to detect it. TPR22-BM lever belt slip switches undertake this task. Belt slip switches sense that the belt is out of alignment and stop the machine completely.

## Unscrambling and aligning conveyor 
The tapered rollers are driven at a single speed and tapered to a minimum diameter to define an alignment region. The tapered rollers create a lateral speed decrease toward the alignment region of the conveyor, causing separation and rotation of the articles, and thereby enabling the articles to be singulated in the alignment region.
