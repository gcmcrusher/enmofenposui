What does Gold Look Like in Nature? Most of the gold that is mined around the world is found in lode sources, also known as hard rock deposits. This is where the gold is actually encased within rocks and must me manually removed from the Earth to extract the gold. The gold bearing material is called ore.

Mar 25, 2022I have been extracting gold from ore for some time now. I buy ore (dirt) containing gold from a person, then I crush it to very small pieces and then put it in cyanide bath. I then drain the bath and add activated carbon which absorbs the gold, I burn the carbon and get the gold. I buy the ore at a high price and I'm barely profitable.

Extraction of Gold using the Borax Process. The borax process is also an environmentally-friendly method of extracting gold. Here the gold-bearing rock material is placed in a melting crucible and then borax (sodium borate) is added. The borax sinks the melting point of the ore mixture and makes the molten mass more fluid.
