## Gold 
Native gold, R30017. Source: Geoscience Australia. Gold, like iron, copper, lead and tin is a metal. Gold is the only yellow metal and is chemically very stable. It does not readily combine with other substances and, therefore, does not corrode or tarnish. Because of this property, it is almost always found in nature as pure gold.

The principal means of access to an underground ore body is a vertical opening called a shaft. The shaft is excavated, or sunk, from the surface downward to a depth somewhat below the deepest planned mining horizon. At regular intervals along the shaft, horizontal openings called drifts are driven toward the ore body.

## Impact Force 
In an impact - like a car crash - the work made by the impact force slowing down an moving object over a distance by deforming the crumple zone can be expressed as. W = Favg s (2) where. W = work done (J, ft lb) Favg = average impact force during deformation (N, lbf) s = deformation distance, crumple zone (m, ft) When a crumple zone deforms in

In real life, gold is one of the softest metals, but in Terraria (as lampshaded by the Goblin Tinkerer) it is harder than such heavy-duty metals as iron or steel.; Even though Gold and Platinum Ore (and Bars) are of nearly equal sell value, 1 Platinum Coin is worth 100 Gold Coins.This is likely because Platinum Ore and Bars were added after Platinum Coins, and also

Using cyanide to recover gold from sulfide ores generally results in 30 to 35% recovery, and the best I have heard of is around 50% recovery. The fine coating of a iron compound definitely appears to be a key component of the inability of cyanide to efficiently leach low grade pyritic ores.
