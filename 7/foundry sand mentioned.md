## Green Sand: An Introduction to Its Use in Foundries
Introduction to Green Sand and Castings. Green sand is a compound mixture used for casting of metals in foundry applications as a mould. It is 'green' not by colour, but takes the moniker due to the fact that it is not 'set' when the metal is poured into

Green Diamond foundry sand is technically an Olivine sand that has been processed by melting, then granulated by quenching in water. It has the same advantages as natural Olivine, which is no free silica and low thermal expansion. This minimizes, or eliminates expansion defects, and reacts basic, rather than acidic like silica sand.

billion BTUs of energy (AFS-FIRST 2016). Reuse of foundry sand is also an effective way to "conserve landfill capacity and save virgin sands" (MarylandDOT 2016). Therefore, advancing the use of foundry sand has become the focus of "intensive market development efforts by the [EPA] and [FHWA]" (AFS-FIRST 2016).

Kleven et al., (2000) observed that foundry sand can be used in the construction of pavement sub base layer (Kirk, 1998; Goodhue et al., 2001). Yucel and Ahmet (2005) advocated that soil-foundry sand mixtures blended with cement/lime can be used in the construction of highway sub base layer and as a fill material (Gedik et al., 2008).

## Waste in the Foundry Industry 
All foundry opera-tions produce castings by pouring mol-ten metal into molds, often consisting of molding sand and core sand. Once the casting has hardened, it is separat-ed from the molding and core materials in the shakeout process. The castings are cleaned, inspected, and then shipped for delivery. Figure 1 is a sche-matic of a typical

01.01.2021The fineness modulus of foundry sand ranges from 0.9 to 1.6 compared to the sand used as a fine aggregate of concrete which has value ranges from 2.3 to 3.1. Therefore, it is necessary to blend foundry sand with coarser sands to meet the requirements of the specifications . In general, foundry sands are dry, with moisture content2 percent.
