If you have the disc in place, start moving the grinder in a front to back or side to side motion until the high spot is ground to the floor level. Repeat this process until the high spot is completely gone.

## Grinding for a Purpose 
07.03.2016Conical burr grinders, like the ubiquitous Mazzer Robur E and Compak K10, have been the industry standard for years. As the name implies, conical burrs are cone-shaped, with a male and female piece. This allows more efficient, faster grinding than with flat burrs. Conical burr grinders produce what is called a bimodal particle size distribution.

## How grinding wheel is made 
People who design grinding wheels consider the friability of their abrasives—which can differ with the nature of the materials being ground—very carefully. For example, while diamond is the hardest known material, it is an undesirable steel abrasive because it undergoes a destructive chemical reaction during the cutting process; the same is true of silicon carbide.
