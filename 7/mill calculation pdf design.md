## Introduction to Milling Tools and Their Application
Milling produces 3-dimensional shapes with a rotating multi-edge cutting tool. The cutting tool can be programmed to move against a fixed workpiece in almost any direction. Milling tools remove material by their movement in the machine and from their shape.

In involute gear design, all contact between two gears occurs in the same fixed, flat plane even as their teeth mesh in and out. Further, the contacting surfaces are always perpendicular to the plane of contact, so the dominant contact forces (in a well lubricated system) are always parallel to the plane. This way, the moment arms are kept constant. This is key to minimizing the
