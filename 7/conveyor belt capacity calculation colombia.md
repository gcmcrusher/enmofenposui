## How Does A Conveyor Belt Work 
Jan 14, 2022How do conveyor systems work. Typically conveyor systems consist of a belt stretched across two or more pulleys. The belt forms a closed loop around the pulleys so it can continually rotate. One pulley known as the drive pulley drives or tows the belt moving items from one location to another.
