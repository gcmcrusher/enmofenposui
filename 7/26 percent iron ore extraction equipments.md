and Pellets. Vale is the world's biggest producer of iron ore and pellets, raw materials essential to the manufacture of steel. Iron ore is found in nature in the form of rocks, mixed with other elements. By means of various industrial processes incorporating cutting-edge technology, iron ore is processed and then sold to steel companies.

## Iron Ore 
Iron ore minerals, particularly hematite and goethite, are beneficiated by a combination of size fraction, preconcentration, and flotation in stages (Fig. 13.45).Iron ore requires removal of silicate impurities of a finer size by flotation for higher-grade products of +60% Fe. ROM ore at 400–600 mm is fed to a primary crusher with product set at –40 mm.

Prices for iron ore cargoes with a 63.5% iron content for delivery into Tianjin rose past $113 per tonne, rebounding from the two-month low of $110 earlier in August with support from speculative buying and restocking activity from steel mills. Improved margins led steel producers in China to restart some halted blast furnaces and drawdown inventories.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

Introduction Iron ore. Iron ore is rock containing enough iron content, and in sufficient volume and accessibility to mining and transportation to be able to be economically mined. Iron in ore iron is most commonly found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite (FeO(OH)), limonite (FeO(OH)n(H 2 O)) or siderite (FeCO 3). Hematite and magnetite are the

03.04.2015Over 300 minerals contain iron but five minerals are the primary sources of iron ore. They are (i) magnetite (Fe3O4), (ii) hematite (Fe2O3), (iii) goethite (Fe2O3.H2O), (iv) siderite (FeCO3), and (v) pyrite (FeS2). The first three are of major importance because of their occurrence in large economically minable deposits.
