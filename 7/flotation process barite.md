About liberation size: Barite is liberated in -212+150 micron with 85%. Galena is liberated in -106+75 micron with 81% and Quartz is liberated in -150+106 micron with 82%. I just do some tests with gravity and flotation methods just for separation of barite and quartz from each other. But not remove of galena.

Flotation is the main process for the recovery of barite from ores Sodium oleate and pine oil are typically used as collector and frother in barite flotation at pH 10 [ 5,6 ] However, oleate is sensitive to slimes [ 7 ], low temperatures [ 8,9 ], and hardwater ions [ 10 ]

barite deposits, where barite has been considered the primary mineral. However, there is a growing trend in processing the ores that contain barite in the form of gangue, which can be applied as the secondary mineral (Bulatovic, 2014). In recent years, since the high-grade resources are being reduced, the processing of low-grade barite

In order to answer the requirements of the mentioned uses, barite and fluorite ores have to undergo an appropriate processing. The method here applied is flotation, during which different reagents, doesn't float barite and could therefore be used in reverse flotation, as also proposed by Ghiani (cit-ed in [11], Carta and Massacci [4].
