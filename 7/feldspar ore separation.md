The ore samples are systematically tested and studied. The raw ore contains K2O 4.37%, Na2O 3.38%, Fe2O3 0.48%, SiO2 77.56% and Al2O3 12.13%. Feldspar is recovered by magnetic separation â€“ flotation combined process. After impurity removal (removal of impurities such as iron, mica and mud), feldspar and quartz are flotation separated.
