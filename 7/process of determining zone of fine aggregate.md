## Aggregates 
Fine aggregates consisting of natural sand and stone are classified into Zone 1 to Zone 4 on their ability to move through 600 microns. From Zone-1 to Zone-4, the zones gradually become finer. 90 to 100 percent of the fine aggregate passes 4.75 mm of IS sieve according to areas, and 0 to 15 percent passes 150 microns of IS sieve.

## What Is Grading Of Aggregates? And Its Limits [Civil Planets]
The aggregates are graded as per IS code 383, when the aggregate size is less than 4.75mm is called fine aggregate more than 4.75mm is called coarse aggregate. The aggregate gradation is determined by the fineness modulus method where aggregates are passing through the sieve as per IS standard to classify its size.

## Classification Test on Aggregate 
Sep 30, 2019The aggregates which pass through the 80 mm sieve and are retained on the 4.75 mm sieve are called as coarse aggregates. Fine Aggregate : All the aggregates which pass through the 4.75 mm sieve are called as fine aggregates. On the basis of particle size distribution, the fine aggregates are classified into four zones – (Zone I to Zone IV.)
