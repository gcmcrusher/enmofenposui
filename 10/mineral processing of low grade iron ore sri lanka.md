## 9 Ore Deposits and Economic Minerals â€“ Mineralogy
The best metal ore minerals are those that contain large amounts of metals of value. Most metallic ore minerals are native elements, sulfides, sulfosalts, oxides, or hydroxides. Ore deposits are highly variable in nature and origin. The most important kinds of ore deposits are magmatic, hydrothermal, and sedimentary.

## Iron Ore Mining 
MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two categories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.

The concentration of a commodity in the ore (the "richness" of the ore) determines the ore grade. When calculating the profitability, amount of reserves and ore grade are the most significant geological factors, although economic factors such as extraction costs, processing costs, and market price are often more decisive. A high-grade ore deposit may be uneconomical to mine
