The improved method involved production of silica aquagel by adding silicate solution to pH 1.5 hydrochloric, citric, or oxalic acid solutions until the pH 4.0 was reached. The aquagel was washed and dried to form silica xerogel. For comparison silica xerogels were also produced at pH 7.0 by the published method.

The invention discloses a novel silica gel washing method. The novel silica gel washing method comprises the following steps: preparing and ageing silica gel; tapping and washing the aged silica gel with seawater instead of tap water; washing the silica gel with tap water; drying the washed silica gel to prepare the silica gel. The gel is washed with seawater, so the limited

In this work, we demonstrated a method where cells are lysed with the in-house prepared AGPC based cell lysis followed by depletion of the gDNA using a silica spin column. After gDNA depletion, the cell lysate was mixed with alcohol and allowed to bind silica-coated magnetic beads, followed by washing and elution of DNA-free total RNA.

When this happens, the fouled columns can be easily regenerated by acid washing. To avoid this problem of fouling and the accompanying need for acid washing, the preferred method of washing the column is to employ a solution with a pH of at least pH 13. The aluminum ion doped wash solutions effectively protect the silica surface during the washing.

Washing and graded. The grade of SiO2 in quartz sand decreases with the finer grain size of quartz sand, and the grade of impurity minerals is the opposite. This phenomenon is especially obvious in quartz sand containing a large number of clay minerals. Therefore, the quartz sand ore before the selection is carried out.
