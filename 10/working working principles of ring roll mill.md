J.F. Cameron, C.G. Clayton, in Radioisotope Instruments, 1971 Cold-strip reduction mills. A tandem cold rolling mill usually consists of three to five stands of rollers, each of which reduces the strip thickness by about 20 to 40% so that the total reduction in one pass may be by a factor ten.. It has long been recognized that some, if not most, of the variations in thickness of strip

4.2.3.1.1 Roll Mills. The roll mill is the simplest batch mixing equipment. The principal design consists of two horizontal rolls, usually of equal size, arranged side by side and rotating toward each other at different speeds. The ratio of the peripheral speeds of the rolls, known as friction ratio, ranges from 1 to 2 but is usually around 1.2.
