12.01.2018Many older operations have rod mills in combination with ball mills. Ball mills are a similar shape to that of the rod mills except that they are shorter with length to diameter ratios of 1 to 1.5. As the name implies, the grinding media in these mills are steel balls. The particles size of the feed usually does not exceed 2.5 cm.

## Cement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball mills 
The grinding process in ball mills and vertical roller mills differ fundamentally. In a ball mill the comminution takes place by impact and attrition. The comminution in the vertical roller mill takes place by exposing a bed of material to a pressure sufficiently high to cause fracture of the individual particles in the bed, although the

## How to calculate motor drive torque for ball screws 
18.05.2016Drive torque is primarily influenced by the axial load on the screw and the screw's lead. F a = total axial force (N) P = lead (mm) η = efficiency of ball screw. The axial load is not only the process force (drilling, punching, etc.), but also includes the force required to move the load. Since most ball screw assemblies use profiled guide

## Feed Rate Calculator 
When milling or drilling, or creating a tool path for a CNC machine the feed rate must be determined. Materials have rated surface speeds for a given type of cutter. The harder the material the slower the speed. Given the diameter of the tool and the surface speed, the RPMs of the spindle can be calculated.

## Ball End Mills 
Ball End Mills. Ball end mills are used for drilling shallow holes, slotting a channel where a flat bottom is not required or most commonly used to produce multi-dimensional contours in molds or dies. The design of ball end mills forms a hemispherical cutting action identical to the diameter of the tool. Because of the shapes required in these

## How to Choose a Stepover 
16.05.2011Here are a few suggestions: The stepover should be between 1/3 and 1/10 of the tool diameter. Use a larger stepover, in the 1/5 to 1/3 range, for soft materials that cannot hold detail well. Use a smaller stepover, in the 1/5 to 1/10 range, for hard materials or materials that can hold significant detail like metal and jewelers wax.
