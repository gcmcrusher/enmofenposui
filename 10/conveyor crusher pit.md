In hard rock mining in-pit crushing Conveying systems are an economical alternative to discontinuous material transport by dump trucks. The crushing of the material with mobile crushing plants right at the face, or with semi-mobile crushing plants placed at a strategic position within the mine, allows the continuous transport of material with belt conveyors.

12.02.2021In-pit crushing and conveying (IPCC) is a material handling system with a feed system, crusher, conveyors and discharge systems as shown in Fig. 1. It involves in-pit crushing of materials. The use of IPCC is justified by its benefits such as reduced operational costs due to minimal trucks usage, high production output and reduced gas emissions.
