For a medium-coarse to coarse grind, you can brew between three to five minutes. The grind size you choose will affect the flavor, of course, but it will also affect how much pressure you need to plunge the coffee. The finer the grind, the more pressure required. This will, in turn, affect the flavor and body of the coffee as well.

15/03/2003This represents an over-speed of about 1.5 times the wheel's designed speed. But the corresponding centrifugal force—and the corresponding rotational stress on the wheel—would be about 2.3 times as much as the maximum allowed. In short, never over-speed a grinding wheel. The speed of the grinder must be compared to the speed marked on the

## Mill Speed 
Medium-speed mills are smaller than low-speed units and are generally of the vertical spindle construction. The speed of the grinding section of these mills is usually 75–225 rpm. They operate on the principles of crushing and attrition. Pulverization takes place between two surfaces, one rolling on top of the other.
