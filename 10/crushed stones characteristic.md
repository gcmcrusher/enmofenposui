## Crushed Limestone As Sub Base Blue Stone 
Crushed Stone 411. 5 10. The final layer of a gravel driveway consists of smaller gravel blended with coarse rock dust, gravel or limestone and sand. The important characteristic of the base material is that the crushed stones have sub-angular edges. This will allow the base to compact together better, to form a strong foundation.

02.10.2007The angle of internal friction of a crushed stone will be directly influenced by type of rock and grain size. Forty-one (41) seems to me possible, but dangerous. I would use a safe 36 degrees unless a direct shear test is performed on a sample. There's at-rest earth pressure and active earth pressure.
