## What Is the Gold Standard? 
There are only about 244,000 metric tons of gold discovered, and there is more than $2 trillion in circulation. If the U.S. were to attempt to go back to the gold standard, it would have to hold all of the gold ever discovered and peg the dollar at roughly $237 an ounce. If you redeemed $1, you'd receive 1/237th of an ounce of gold at that price.

## gold rush 
gold rush, rapid influx of fortune seekers to the site of newly discovered gold deposits. Major gold rushes occurred in the United States, Australia, Canada, and South Africa in the 19th century. The first major gold strike in North America occurred near Dahlonega, Georgia, in the late 1820s. It was the impetus for the Indian Removal Act (1830) and led to the Trail of Tears.

## Green Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles Using Aqueous Extract 
Abstract. The synthesis of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) is performed by the reduction of aqueous gold metal ions in contact with the aqueous peel extract of plant, Garcinia mangostana ( G. mangostana ). An absorption peak of the gold nanoparticles is observed at the range of 540–550 nm using UV-visible spectroscopy.
