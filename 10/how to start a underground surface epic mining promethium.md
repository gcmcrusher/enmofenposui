## Strip Mining 
Coal is primarily obtained by surface mining (sometimes called " strip mining," but not by the industry) and underground mining. There are two main sources of power plant coal in the United States: (1) Pennsylvanian-age coals in eastern basins like the Appalachian, Illinois, and Black Warrior, and (2) Paleocene-age coals in western states

## How to Advance Sustainable Mining 
18.10.2021Regulating these activities mainly depends on national frameworks and policies, but implementing good practices remains problematic. To truly shift to "sustainable mining," governments and companies must recognize the social impacts of mining, and enact laws and regulations that require community consultation throughout the life of a mine.

## Everything you need to know about Bitcoin mining
Bitcoin mining is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so that the number of blocks found each day by miners remains steady. Individual blocks must contain a proof of work to be considered valid. This proof of work is verified by other Bitcoin nodes each time they receive a block. Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof-of-work

## Salt Mining 
Nov 27, 2007Many salt mines use the room and pillar system of mining. Shafts are sunk down to the floor of the mine, and rooms are carefully constructed by drilling, cutting and blasting between the shafts, creating a checkerboard pattern. After the salt is removed and crushed, a conveyor belt hauls it to the surface. Most salt produced this way is used
