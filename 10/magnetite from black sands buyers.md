## Magnetite 
Magnetite is a black, opaque, magnetic mineral that leaves a black streak when rubbed across a hard rough surface. It is one of the most abundant metal oxides, and its crystal structure contains both the ferrous (Fe+2) and ferric (Fe+3) forms of iron ions. A complex pattern of electrons between the two forms of iron is the source of its

It is used as an iron ore. The black grains are titanomagnetite (total titanium content of the sample is 4 percent). Iron makes up 20 percent of the sample (XRF data). Yellow grains are silicate minerals. Width of view 10 mm. It is a major constituent in a heavy mineral fraction of sand. Lots of black minerals on this gold pan are magnetite grains.
