It is used as an iron ore. The black grains are titanomagnetite (total titanium content of the sample is 4 percent). Iron makes up 20 percent of the sample (XRF data). Yellow grains are silicate minerals. Width of view 10 mm. It is a major constituent in a heavy mineral fraction of sand. Lots of black minerals on this gold pan are magnetite grains.
