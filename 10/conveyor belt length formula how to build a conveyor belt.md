Screw Take-up. The screw take-up design utilizes mechanical force to take-up any slack in the belt. This is done by adjusting a threaded tensioning screw integrated into the conveyor frame on each side of the tail pulley. By adjusting the screw, the tail pulley can be either pushed outward or pulled inward. Since this requires manual adjustment
