A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.

Any fluctuation in pressure means that the optimal force will not be delivered consistently so, of course, crusher performance declines. These are the two main causes of sub-optimal crushing performance, but losses in the reduction ratio can also be caused by selecting the wrong mantle or by having a poor chamber profile or design.
