18/05/2011Conventional utility-scale wind turbines often use three- stage gearboxes. The first stage is often a planetary drive because that design handles high torque best. The later two stages use helical gears. To give an idea of the torque coming from a rotor, consider a 1.5-MW turbine working at its rated output. 1.5 MW = 2,011 hp.

## Lubrication Selection for Enclosed Gear Drives
The viscosity grade selection is based upon the industrial gear drive's horsepower rating, reduction ratio, the speed of the gear drive in rpm and the type of lubrication method used to lubricate the gears. The fourth and final method that can be used to select the viscosity grade uses the following equation. 1. Calculate the Viscosity.

## Gear Reduction in Electric Motors 
01/06/2015The "reduction" or gear ratio is calculated by dividing the number of teeth on the large gear by the number of teeth on the small gear. For example, if an electric motor drives a 13-tooth pinion gear that meshes with a 65-tooth gear, a reduction of 5:1 is achieved (65 / 13 = 5). If the electric motor speed is 3,450 rpm, the gearbox reduces
