## Barytes 
Barite (Barytes) in the Paint Industry. Barite is used as a filler in the manufacture of paints. It helps to regulate the thickness and the stability of the paint. Barite also makes the paint brighter. It gives uniformity to the paint's texture which in turn increases the smoothness of the finish. It is also used as a pigment for paints.
