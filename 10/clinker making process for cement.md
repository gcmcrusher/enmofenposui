2. The limestone is combined with clay, iron ore and sand. It is then ground in a crusher and fed into. 3. Next, the fine powder is heated as it passes through the Pre-Heater Tower into a large kiln. In the kiln, the powder is heated to 1500oC. This creates a new product, called clinker, which resembles pellets about the size of marbles.
