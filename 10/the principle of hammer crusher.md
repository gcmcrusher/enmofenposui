## What Is Impact Crusher
Impact crusher working principle. When the stone falls into the working area of the blow bar (hammer), it is crushed by the impact of the blow bar on the high-speed rotating rotor, and is thrown to the apron for a second impact, and rebounds until the rotating blow bar (hammer) is hit again. This process is repeated until the material is

Hammer crusher working principle. The hammer crusher has 3 stages to process the feed: impact, shear and attrition. The material enters the crushing cavity from the inlet, and contacts the group of hammers (chromium-manganese alloy) on the rotor. The hammers are fixed on the horizontal shaft (rotor) rotating at high speed.
