## Pulp density and adjustment in flotation plant
07.09.2021Pulp density refers to the content of solid mineral particles in the pulp. There are usually two ways to express: (1) liquid-solid ratio, indicates the ratio of liquid to solid weight (or volume) in the pulp, sometimes also known as dilution; (2) percent solid content (%), indicates the percentage of solids by weight (or volume) in the pulp

23.11.2020In general, the single mineral flotation results from this study have demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of this new concept. However, it needs to be noted that the application of this approach and the optimum pulp potential in a processing plant should also consider the ore mineralogy and plant flowsheet.

Zinc Processing Plant. 【Introduction】: The main minerals in zinc ore are sphalerite, marmatite, smithsonite and hemimorphite. The zinc sulfide mineral is sphalerite, and the main zinc oxide minerals are smithsonite and hemimorphite. Flotation process is often used as the zinc extraction process. 【Application】:

## Review on advances in mineral processing technologies suitable 
01.04.2022The first comminution stage in a mineral processing plant is crushing, which reduces the size of particles from up to 1 m down to 0.5 cm (depending on the type of milling circuit). Crushing is typically a dry process that makes use of Gyratory, Jaw, and Cone crushers (Napier-Munn et al., 1996), which predominantly make use of impact mechanism.

27.06.2022Surface oxidation of the sulfide minerals negatively affects the flotation performance, i.e., the selectivity and even the recoveries at heavy oxidation conditions. Oxidation may take place during the formation of the ore, during mining and stockpiling, and during the flotation process. Stockpiling of large amounts of ore is a common practice in mine sites for

23.11.2020Efficient separation of naturally hydrophobic gangue, such as talc and carbonaceous materials, from sulphide minerals in flotation is becoming a significant challenge in many processing plants due to the need to process lower grade and more complex ores.
