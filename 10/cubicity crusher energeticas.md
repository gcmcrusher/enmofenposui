However, the degree of crushing is rather low, as is the cubicity of the end grain, because of the construction design. The analysis values are weak. VORTEX rotor crushers can cope with even the hardest of rocks and stones, whilst still achieving a high degree of efficiency, outstanding cubicity, and excellent grading curves.
