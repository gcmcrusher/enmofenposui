## Uses of Chromium 
Chromite, the only ore of chromium, was first discovered in the United States sometime about 1808 on the farm of Isaac Tyson, Jr., just north of Baltimore, Md. Scattered deposits of chromium minerals in an area of northeastern Maryland and southeastern Pennsylvania were the source of nearly all of the chromium products in the world between 1828 and 1850.
