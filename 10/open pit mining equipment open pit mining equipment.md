## Open Pit Mining 
Large, low-grade ore deposits are usually economically attractive because it permits high recovery of the resource and allows sufficient space for large and efficient mining equipment. An open pit mine could recover almost 90% of the oil shale in a very thick deposit [17]. It is said that strip mining could provide an even higher recovery.
