(not yet open for business) Sedimentary rocks are commonly grouped according to whether they are clastic, biochemical, or chemical. This works fine, except that it is not clear whether some limestones

## Sedimentary Rocks 
All sedimentary rocks contain significant amounts of iron (typically ranging from 1 to 2% to about 8 or 9%), and, in that sense, mudrocks, sandstone, and carbonates can all be considered as "iron-bearing" sedimentary rocks. However, certain sedimentary rocks contain inordinately high amounts of iron (defined as an iron content in excess of 15%). These iron-bearing

## Sedimentary Rock Formation Explained 
Chemical Precipitate: Sediments formed from deposition of chemical reaction precipitates of mineral solutions are called chemical sedimentary rocks. Their formation occurs when water dissolves many minerals and deposits them on evaporation. Examples of this type are gypsum, barite, rock salt, and sylvite.

Clastic sediment is made up of inorganic rock and mineral fragments, called clasts. These can come from igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic rocks, and so they can include a very wide range of minerals.

## Gypsum Mining 
Gypsum is a mineral found in crystal as well as masses called gypsum rock. It is a very soft mineral and it can form very pretty, and sometimes extremely large colored crystals. Massive gypsum rock forms within layers of sedimentary rock, typically found in thick beds or layers. It forms in lagoons where ocean waters high in calcium and sulfate

The sediments are deposited at the earth's surface by water, wind, glacial ice, or bio-chemical processes. Typically the sediments are deposited in layers under COOL conditions [thereby distinguishing it from a layered volcanic rock (TUFF)].

A rock resulting from the consolidation of loose sediment that has accumulated in layers; e.g., a clastic rock (such as conglomerate or tillite) consisting of mechanically formed fragments of older rock transported from its source and deposited in water or from air or ice; or a chemical rock (such as rock salt or gypsum) formed by precipitation from solution; or an organic rock (such
