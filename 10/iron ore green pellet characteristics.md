## Iron Ore Pellet Production 
Pellets are a high-grade source of iron ore and are produced via a type of agitation agglomeration (wet granulation or tumble-growth agglomeration) known as pelletizing, and referred to in the iron ore sector as "balling.". The balling process is carried out utilizing either a rotary drum or disc pelletizer – otherwise known as a balling

Iron Ore Pelletization. DESCRIPTION. GIMBOND is natural high swelling sodium based bentonite of exceptional purity. It is mined and processed in North West part of India. GIMBOND is sodium activated bentonite designed to meet the requirements of pelletization industries. GIMBOND is used as green and dry ore binder for all kind of pellets.

Iron ore green pellets are widely used in steel industry. In the manufacturing of green pellets in disc pelletizer, the pellet moisture (PM) should be frequently monitored to guarantee product quality. Current methods for PM measurement are off-line and time-consuming, which cannot meet the requirement for real-time measurement and control of pelletizing process. To solve

## Iron ore 
There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.
