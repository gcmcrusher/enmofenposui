## History of sugar 
The Portuguese took sugar to Brazil.By 1540, there were 800 cane sugar mills in Santa Catarina Island and there were another 2,000 on the north coast of Brazil, Demarara, and Surinam.The first sugar harvest happened in Hispaniola in 1501; and many sugar mills had been constructed in Cuba and Jamaica by the 1520s..

## Technology of production of edible flours and protein products 
The final milling is critical and energy consuming. Although identity standards require milling to 97% minus 100-mesh, specialty flours (such as those used as milk solids replacement in infant formulae) are ground to a finer particle size. At such levels of fineness, the conventional hammer mill is practically useless.

Mill would diverge from Bentham in developing the 'altruistic' approach to Utilitarianism (which is actually a misnomer, but more on that later).
