## Soil Stabilization using Crusher Dust – IJERT
24.04.2018The main objective of the soil stabilization is to increase the bearing capacity of the soil and maximum dry density. This paper assesses the stabilizing effect of crusher dust on the soil. Crusher dust is added to the soil at varying proportions like 20%, 30% and 40% by the weight of the soil sample throughout.

Additive silos similar to aggregate cement silos, the additives are also stored in silos. Usually two groups of silos are constituted, one of greater capacity for the majority additives, and another of smaller capacity for the minority additives. The loading of these silos is done manually, since the additives are normally purchased in bags or big-bags- these bags will be lifted using a hoist.
