## Grinding Milling 
Powder processing often involves bulk powders, additives, or ingredients being milled for particle size reduction. A mill or grinder uses a mechanical action to break the material and reduce it to the required size. This may encompass a whole range of requirements from de-agglomeration and coarse grinding through to fine grinding and classifying.
