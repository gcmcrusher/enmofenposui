09/11/2017Trace Na sources, extraction dynamics of trace Na, and influences of calcination temperature on quartz lattice, fluid inclusions, and muscovite were studied in detail herein for trace Na extraction from the quartz ore with water leaching at 90C. Experimental results suggested that the trace Na sources included quartz lattice, fluid inclusions, and muscovite.
