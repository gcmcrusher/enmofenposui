Jun 29, 2021Because the density of manganese oxide ore such as pyrolusite, pyrolusite, and brown manganese ore is about 4g/m, which is significantly different from the density of silicate gangue, most of them can use gravity separation. Manganese carbonate ore mostly adopts the combined process of dense medium and strong magnetic separation.
