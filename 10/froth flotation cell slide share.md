05/11/2013The main goal in froth flotation is to maximize grade and recovery of the desired mineral, while maintaining stable and upset-free operation (Fuerstenau, 2007). However, with highly varying feed properties and other related operating parameters, potentially leading to poor froth stability, which can result in reduced grade and/or recovery of

## Froth flotation 
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic. This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.

## The Froth in Froth Flotation 
ABSTRACT. Froth flotation is a highly selective method of separating value ore particles from gangue solids which has made it the most widely used process in minerals beneficiation. The process involves bubble-particle attachments in a vigorously stirred concentrated pulp followed by further transport of the stable aggregates to the froth layer.

Froth flotation is widely used in the resource industry as a particle separation process. The performance of the flotation process is significantly affected by the mobility of the froth phase. Despite its importance, little work has been done to develop a simple and robust method for indicating froth mobility. In the present study, a simple method to monitor froth mobility was

## Froth Flotation Cell 
Froth Flotation Cell Description : Mixed liberated particles can be separated from each other by floatation if there is sufficient difference in their wettability. The floatation process operates by preparing a water suspension of a mixture of relatively finely sized solids. This is usually done in an agitated chamber open at the top. Fine bubbles Continue reading Froth Flotation Cell

## 10.5 Algae Harvesting and Separation Technologies 
Algae can be harvested using: 1) sedimentation (gravity settling), 2) membrane separation (micro/ultra filtration), 3) flocculation, 4) flotation, and 5) centrifugation. Sedimentation is the initial phase of separating the algae from water. Once agitation is completed, the algae are allowed to settle and densify.
