## Calculation of energy required for grinding in a ball mill
Jan 01, 1989INTRODUCTION The energy consumption for grinding, according to Bond (1961), is deter- mined by the formula: / 10 10 (I) The work index is determined by grinding experiments carried out in a labo- ratory Bond ball mill. Based on the results of grinding experiments, numerical values of the work index Wi are calculated according to the formula
