## Definition of portland cement 
The first patent for portland cement was obtained in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin, an English mason. The specific gravity of portland cement particles is about 3.15. There are four primary phases in portland cement: tricalcium silicate (C 3 S), dicalcium silicate (C 2 S), tricalcium aluminate (C 3 A), and tetracalcium aluminoferrite (C 4 AF). The

## Manufacture of Portland Cement: 3 Processes 
ADVERTISEMENTS: Portland cement can be manufactured by intimately mixing together calcareous and argillaceous stones containing silica, alumina, and iron oxide etc. and burning it in large rotary kilns at a temperature of approximately 1400C to 1500C. At his temperature the materials partially fuse, forming clinker. This clinker is cooled and ground to fine power.

31/08/2009Portland cement can be made by following two different processes – a dry one and a wet one. Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century. Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement. The materials that are commonly used are limestone, shells, chalk, shale, clay, slate, silica sand, and iron ore.
