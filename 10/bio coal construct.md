Coal is slightly denser than water (1.0 megagram per cubic metre) and significantly less dense than most rock and mineral matter (e.g., shale has a density of about 2.7 megagrams per cubic metre and pyrite of 5.0 megagrams per cubic metre). Density differences make it possible to improve the quality of a coal by removing most of the rock matter

The answer has to do with oxygen (molecular oxygen). Combustion requires oxygen and only gasoline or alcohol exposed to oxygen can burn. In the liquid form, both substances are packed tight enough to prevent too much oxygen from entering the liquid. This is why gasoline burns better when sprayed into an engine by a fuel injector.

## Catalysis and the Use of Energy by Cells 
Two opposing streams of chemical reactions occur in cells: (1) the catabolic pathways break down foodstuffs into smaller molecules, thereby generating both a useful form of energy for the cell and some of the small molecules that the cell needs as building blocks, and (2) the anabolic, or biosynthetic, pathways use the energy harnessed by catabolism to drive the synthesis of the
