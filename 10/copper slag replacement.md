## Copper Slag As Cement Replacement 
Copper slag produced during the matte smelting and refining of copper ore, during which, the iron present in the copper concentrate combines chemically at 1200C with silica present in flux materials such as river sand/silica sand/ quartz fines to form iron silicate, which is termed as copper slag. The copper slag thus generated is quenched

## Copper Slag Short Presentation 
COPPER SLAG. Copper slag is a by-product created during the coppersmeltingand refining process. As refineries draw metal out of copper ore, they produce a large volume of non-metallic dust, soot, and rock. Collectively, these materials make up slag, which can be used for a surprising number of applications in the building and industrial fields. This material represents

## Copper Slag 
One of the greatest potential applications for reusing copper slag is in cement and concrete production. Many researchers have investigated the use of copper slag in the production of cement, mortar, and concrete as mixed with lime stone powder, dust, cement replacement, use as partial replacement of coarse, and fine aggregates.
