23/01/2012Step #8 – Refining (off-site) Once basic processing is done, the ore is taken to a refinery where the remaining impurities are stripped out. Crude gold is melted and treated with chloride, which converts any remaining foreign metals to chloride which will then drift off the gold. The result is 99.5% pure gold, which is then cast into
