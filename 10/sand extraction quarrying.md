## What is Quarrying?
Quarrying is defined as any mineral extraction work that is done on the surface of the earth. While, mining typically occurs beneath the earth's surface and in enclosed spaces. In Australia, quarrying is its own industry — generating more than $160 billion in revenue, and creating thousands of jobs, often in rural and regional areas.
