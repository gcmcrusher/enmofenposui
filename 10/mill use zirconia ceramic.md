## Zirconia conductive ceramics 
02.04.2021Manufacturing process of zirconia conductive ceramics. The key to the manufacture of zirconia (ZrO2) conductive ceramics is the purity of the raw materials and the preparation of the powder. Generally, the purity of ZrO2 should be 99.5%, which is an ultrafine powder (0.05μm); the stabilizer is Y2O3 or Al2O3. The purity should be reagent grade.

## Advanced Ceramics 
Zirconia is a unique advanced ceramic - a chemical compound having the formula ZrO2. Products manufactured from Tosoh's yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powder exhibit superior mechanical properties such as high strength and flexibility. As a technological breakthrough, YSZ surpasses the strength limitations of traditional fine ceramics.

## An overview of zirconia ceramics: Basic properties and clinical 
01.11.2007Zirconia (ZrO 2) is a ceramic material with adequate mechanical properties for manufacturing of medical devices. Zirconia stabilized with Y 2 O 3 has the best properties for these applications. When a stress occurs on a ZrO 2 surface, a crystalline modification opposes the propagation of cracks. Compression resistance of ZrO 2 is about 2000 MPa.
