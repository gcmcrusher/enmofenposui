## Wet and Dry Etching 
dry etching has the ability to etch with finer resolution and higher aspect ratio than isotropic etching. Due to the directional nature of dry etching, undercutting can be avoided. Figure 4 shows a rendition of the reaction that takes place in chemical dry etching. Some of the ions that are used in chemical dry etching is tetrafluoromethane (CH 4
