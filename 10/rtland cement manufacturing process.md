Aug 24, 2018 Wet process. There are two different processes of manufacturing cement. wet process minerals are wet ground (by adding water) to form a slurry and then dried, dry process minerals are dry ground to form a powder like substance.Both the processes are in use and have their own advantages and disadvantages.While in wet process grinding is easier,in dry

## A practical guide to improving cement manufacturing processes 
Cement manufacturing is the source of 5% of global CO 2 emissions. 60% of emissions are due to the transformation of raw materials at high temperatures and 40% results from the combustion required to heat the cement kilns 1400C to1500C. Therefore emissions monitoring is extremely critical for cement plants to meet regulatory requirements.
