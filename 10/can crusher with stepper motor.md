In general case, each step in a stepper motor moves 1.8 degree and hence it takes 200 steps for a rotor to finish a single rotation. The stepper motors are also available with step angles 30, 15, 5, 2.5 and 2. The stepper motor is operated based on the principle of electromagnetism and can be controlled with or without feedback.

## Stepper Motor Technology 
With two coils, this means there can be 4 discrete positions per pole pitch. A 2-phase motor, for example, with 12-pole pairs in each stator / coil sector will therefore have 48 steps per revolution or 7.5 degrees per step. High-performance, Portescap stepper motors provide accuracy and torque to meet numerous application needs:

## Understanding Stepper Motors 
The stepper motor is an electromechanical device that converts electrical pulses into discrete mechanical movements, and therefore can be operated directly from a pulse train or a microprocessor. The shaft of a stepper motor rotates in discrete step increments when electrical command pulses are applied to it in the proper sequence. The motor's rotation has several

## Stepper Motor Accuracy 
According to the specification of a typical hybrid step motor, the device can position within 0.09. The factors affecting this positional accuracy are the precision to which the stator and rotor components are punched and assembled, the concentricity of the air gap, and the current balance of the two phases as provided by the step motor driver.

18/06/2009The stepper itself locks magnetically when the driving sequence stops. With two coils on, it heats up. When power is removed, other things happen: The stepper takes half a step. The stepper still locks the shaft, more weakly. The stepper controller loses all knowledge of where it is, unless there's an absolute encoder or equivalent in the system.

01/04/2019The motor then moves in accurate and fixed angle increments, hence the name "stepper". The stepper motor works similarly to brushless DC motors, except that it moves in much smaller steps. Its only moving part is also the rotor, which contains the magnets. An alternating current controls the polarity of each coil.

04/03/2019The 28BYJ-48 stepper motor is a commonly used stepper motor. which converts electrical pulses into discrete mechanical rotation. When electrical signals are applied, the stepper motor rotates in precise and fixed angle increments known as steps. The motor consists of 4 coils that make a ring around the rotor. These coils are known as the stator, as they are
