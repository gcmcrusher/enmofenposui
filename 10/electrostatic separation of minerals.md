## electrostatic separation mineral 
06/08/2021 Mineral separation technologies that do not use water, in particular, are gaining attention. These technologies are often based on gravity,ic and electrostatic forces. New developments in mineral separation exploiting these forces have the potential to enhance, optimise and/or transform the environmental impact of mineral processing.
