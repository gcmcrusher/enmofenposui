## Smelting 
16.3.2.1 Background. Smelting is a form of extractive metallurgy to produce a metal from its ore. Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gasses or slag and leaving just the metal behind. The reducing agent is commonly a source of carbon such as coke, charcoal, and coal.

## Chapter 6 Copper Production Technology 
Figure 6-2.—Early Smelting Technology Charcoal ore flux m The Egyptian copper smelting furnace was filled with a mixture of copper ore, charcoal and iron ore to act as a flux. It was blown for several hours by foot or hand bellows. By the end of the smelt the copper had separated from the slag, which was tapped off.

## Namibia Custom Smelter
Production officially started on March 3, 1964. At that stage, the Smelter produced more than 3,500 tons of copper and 6,000 tons of lead per month. By 1986 the Smelter was also producing sodium antimonite for export. In 1988, TCL was taken over by Gold Fields South Africa and administered by Gold Fields Namibia (GFN).

## Copper Recovery Through Smelter Slag Flotation in Atacama, 
13.01.2021Copper slag flotation was studied on an industrial scale at a concentrator plant in the region of Atacama, Chile. This study consisted of the physical, chemical, and mineralogical characterization of the copper slag, along with preliminary flotation tests. This article focuses on industrial flotation, which consisted of two oneyear campaigns (2016 and 2017).

## The Smelting Industry: Global Importance And Risks
25.04.2017Smelting utilizes heat, and a reduction agent like coal, to extract the other elements from the metal according to Cornish Mining World Heritage. This results in a more refined metal product. Among the metals extracted by smelting are copper, lead, nickel, zinc, silver, cobalt, cadmium, gold, aluminum, and others. Primary smelting processes the mine ore and

## Nickel Smelting and Refining 
In flash smelting, dry sulfide ore containing less than 1% moisture is fed to the furnace along with preheated air, oxygen-enriched air (30–40% oxygen), or pure oxygen. Iron and sulfur are oxi-dized. The heat that results from exothermic re-actions is adequate to smelt concentrate, producing a liquid matte (up to 45% nickel) and a fluid slag.
