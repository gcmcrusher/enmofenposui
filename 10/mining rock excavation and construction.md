Mining Excavation. the artificial creation of cavities in the earth's crust through the extraction of rock; the cavities, or excavations, that are created are used to open mineral deposits, transport minerals, and ventilate mines. Excavations include shafts, galleries, crosscuts, and horizontal and inclined excavations (drifts, chutes, inclines).
