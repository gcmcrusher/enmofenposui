17/05/2022The raw siderite ore was crushed in a jaw crusher (PowerScreen (PSC 60 100), Westport, CT, USA) and then ground in a ball mill (φ305 305 mm). Finally, the material was sieved using an 80 m square hole sieve, and the sieved material was thoroughly homogenized. Siderite ores displayed an evident iron phase transformation during

## Processes 
14/10/2019Iron ore was studied as a CO2 absorbent. Carbonation was carried out by mechanochemical and high temperature–high pressure (HTHP) reactions. Kinetics of the carbonation reactions was studied for the two methods. In the mechanochemical process, it was analyzed as a function of the CO2 pressure and the rotation speed of the planetary ball mill,
