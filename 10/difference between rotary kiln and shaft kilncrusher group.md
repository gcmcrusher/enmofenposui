## Why is the surface of the rotary kiln supporting roller seriously 
During the operation of the rotary kiln, when the cylinder is bent, the inclination of the live ring will change relative to the supporting roller every time the kiln body rotates one circle. The contact surface between the rollers becomes uneven, resulting in increased wear on the surface of the roller when the pressure on the tyre and the surface of the roller increases in a local area.

Around 1885, experiments began on design of continuous kilns. One design was the shaft kiln, similar in design to a blast furnace. for many years there was little difference in efficiency between the two processes, and the overwhelming majority of kilns used the wet process. By 1950, a typical large, wet process kiln, fitted with drying
