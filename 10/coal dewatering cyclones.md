## Novel Fine Particle Dewatering 
29.07.2011The dewatering of fine coal is widely considered to be the most difficult and costly step in coal preparation. The cost of dewatering is a strong function of particle size and increases sharply for particles finer than 28 mesh. In fact, many coal producers often find it to be more economical to discard fine coal provided it constitutes only a

Overview. Parnaby offer an extensive range of sizing screens to suit all applications. One of the key components of any wet processing setup is the de-watering screens. As critical as it can be to get the material wet for effective processing in a wash plant, it is equally important to de-water the products prior to sale or disposal.

Because of the issues concerning fine coal cleaning and dewatering, coal producers are often coal fines to waste ponds. The current trend in the U.S. is to deslime fine coal prior to flotation using 15 -cm (6 inch) diameter classifying cyclones to remove the bulk of the -45 m materials (Bethell et al., 2005).

## How to Fix Common Issues with Hydrocyclones 
To fix this, increase the density of solids feeding the hydrocyclone, or decrease the size of the apex. The apex will be the fastest wearing part of most units. When the apex wears out, the opening gets larger, therefore allowing more water to go out the underflow. To fix this, replace the apex with a new one.

## Radial Manifold 
Radial Manifold. MEP Cyclones are often fitted to radial manifolds which are designed to evenly distribute the feed and collect the overflow and underflow streams from the cyclones. Cyclone manifolds or clusters are used when processing high volumes and finer cut sizes are required. They are used to recover solids down to 35 microns and save
