## Direct Mechanocatalysis: Using Milling Balls as Catalysts
21.04.2020As mentioned above, the rotational speed (planetary ball mill) or milling frequency (vibrational ball mill) are an easy to adjust parameter to control the energy input in the milled powder. In the past it has been shown, that by increasing the speed, the grain size of the obtained powder can be reduced and in general reactions are proceeding faster.
