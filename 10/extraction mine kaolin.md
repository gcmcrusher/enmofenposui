## Kaolin 
Kaolin is formed when the anhydrous aluminum silicates found in feldspathic rocks, like granite, are altered by weathering or hydrothermal processes. The process which converted the hard granite into the soft matrix found in kaolin pits is known as 'kaolinization'. The quartz and mica of the granite remain relatively unchanged whilst the

## Kaolin 
Kaolin is an aluminosilicate soft white mineral named after the hill in China (Kao-ling) from which it was mined for centuries. In its natural state kaolin is a white, soft powder consisting principally of the mineral kaolinite, and varying amounts of other minerals such as muscovite, quartz, feldspar, and anatase.
