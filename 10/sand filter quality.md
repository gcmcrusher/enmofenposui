Use only special pool-grade filter sand, free of all limestone or clay: #20 Silica sand 0.45-0.85mm, approximately one 9kg bag should suffice. If you do not use the recommended size of filter sand, filtering performance will be reduced and the sand filter may damaged, thereby voiding the warranty. NOTE:

For industrial water filtration purposes vertical filter bed speeds (ideal service flows) varying between 10 m/h and 25 m/h are used depending on the quality of the to be treated water. The higher the total suspended solids (TSS indicated in mg/l) content or the more turbid the water, the slower the vertical filter bed speed.

## Slow Sand Filtration 
Slow sand filters are the least complex type of granular media filter. They are typically housed in reinforced concrete structures, with a basin with a bed of relatively fine sand placed over support gravel (0.3–0.6 m in depth) and underdrain piping up to 0.9–1.5 m in length. The filtration rate is from 0.08 to 0.4 m/h.
