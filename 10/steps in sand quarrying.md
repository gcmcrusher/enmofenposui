Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.

M20 and M25 grades of concrete were taken for study keeping a constant slump of 60mm. The compressive strength of concrete cubes at the age of 7 and 28 days were obtained at room temperature. Also the temperature effect on concrete
