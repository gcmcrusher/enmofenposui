## Using Dual Power Supplies for Mining 
Running Dual Power Supplies in Mining Rigs. When you stack multiple GPUs in a mining PC you start to use a lot of power very fast! In some cases a single GPU can eat up 200 watts of electricity. However, in most mining PCs the GPUs will only use around 160 watts. Even still, 160 watts multiplied by six is 960 watts.

Step 6.b: Once it's disabled, you may want to restart your rig and check and make sure the card is still disabled in the device manager. Step 6.c: If it's still disabled once you restart, then go ahead and start the miner with no overclock settings and let it run until the GPUs begin to warm up. The reason for this is because I'm feeling my way around the rig to locate the cold disabled GPU.
