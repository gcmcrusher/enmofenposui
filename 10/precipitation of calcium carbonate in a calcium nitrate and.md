## Calcium Nitrate – Structure, Preparation, Uses and FAQs
Chemical Properties of Ca (NO3)2. On adding the calcium nitrate compound to sodium carbonate, the calcium carbonate precipitate is formed by leaving the sodium nitrate in the solution. The chemical equation can be given as follows. Ca (NO3)2 + Na2CO3 → 2 NaNO3 + CaCO3. And, on heating, it undergoes decomposition and releases oxygen and

## Calcium nitrate 
Calcium nitrate is mainly used as a component in fertilizers, The calcium ion accelerates formation of calcium hydroxide and thus precipitation and setting. This effect is used also in cold weather concreting agents as well as some combined plasticizers. The nitrate ion leads to formation of iron hydroxide, whose protective layer reduces corrosion of the concrete
