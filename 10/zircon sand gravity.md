## ABOUT MINERAL SANDS – Everlast Minerals
Mineral Sands contain suites of minerals with having high specific gravity known as Heavy Minerals (HM). Heavy mineral sands having more than specific gravity of 2.9 are placer deposits usually concentrated at beach environment by surf and longshore currents and at river sand bars by river wave action due to specific gravity of the mineral grains.

## Heavy Mineral Sand 
Earlier in this chapter the possibility of combined magnetic and electrical separation was noted, particularly in the processing of heavy mineral sand deposits. Table 13.3 shows some of the common minerals present in such alluvial deposits, along with their properties, related to magnetic and electrical separation. Mineral sands are commonly mined by floating dredges, feeding
