## Concrete Production And Diminishing Coal Burning 
Feb 16, 2017The amount of fly ash used in concrete products increased by 5% between 2011 and 2017 while the amount produced dropped by 36%. Concrete production continues to increase steadily while fly ash production is steadily dropping. Therefore, the concrete industry is looking for alternative sources of SCM.

## Use of the alternative fuels in the cement industry
Use of coal during production of cement . Coal is fuel sediment which consists of products of disintegration of plants. Process of creation of coal is based on increase of relative content of carbon (C) and decrease of content of oxygen (O. 2), of nitrogen (N. 2) and hydrogen (H. 2).

## Cement Industry 
The Indian cement industry uses coal because of its abundant availability and shortage of oil and natural gas. Today the Indian cement industry has to use coal of high ash content with varying characteristics. To resolve this problem, the role of coal on cement making and possible improvements in coal quality and consistency have been explored

## Researchers use coal waste to create sustainable concrete 
Jul 12, 2018Washington State University researchers have created a sustainable alternative to traditional concrete using coal fly ash, a waste product of coal-based electricity generation. The advance tackles two major environmental problems at once by making use of coal production waste and by significantly reducing the environmental impact of concrete
