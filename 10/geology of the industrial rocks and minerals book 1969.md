## Rocks Minerals 
Geologists are not just interested in using rock types to understand the geologic history of a region. It is also important to understand the distribution of rocks and minerals for practical applications. Mineral resources include nonfood, nonfuel materials such as metals (e.g., aluminum, gold) and industrial minerals (e.g., gypsum, phosphate

Rocks and minerals are important for learning about earth materials, structure, and systems. Studying these natural objects incorporates an understanding of earth science, chemistry, physics, and math. The learner can walk away with an understanding of crystal geometry, the ability to visualize 3-D objects, or knowing rates of crystallization.
