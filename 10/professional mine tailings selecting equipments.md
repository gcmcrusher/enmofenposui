## Tailings Waste 
Reduce risks. Industry trends—towards risk mitigation, water conservation and the increasing importance of the social license to operate—present tailings storage challenges. In some cases, the adoption of alternative tailings disposal methods, such as thickened, paste, filtered, or tailings and waste rock co-disposal may be the solution.

Especially in small mines, tailings are piled up randomly, occupying land and polluting the environment. Reason 3: A lot of construction waste is wasted. In addition, in urban planning and construction, a large amount of construction waste is generated, which can actually be crushed by crushers to produce artificial sand and aggregates, thereby promoting resource

## Mining Method Selection Factors
5. (iii) Method of Mining: The method of mining depends on the mode of occur rence of the ores. The open-cast mining is the cheapest, while shaft mines are very expensive. The cost of mining also depends on the scale of operations. If the mining has been done at a large scale, the capital and running costs can be offset.
