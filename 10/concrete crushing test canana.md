## Crushing Test or Compression strength Test on stone 
The Crushing strength or compressive strength is given by the formula as: C= P/A. Where, C = compressive strength. P = Load at failure. A = cross-sectional area of bearing face of the specimen. Then the average value of the six specimens is calculated and the result is recorded for that stone sample. You may also like.

## Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) Sets 
The Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) Test Set provides a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. Each set consists of steel cylinder, plunger, base plate, cylindrical measure and tamping rod. All parts of the apparatus are powder coated or galvanized steel, heat treated and ground before manufacturing to make it
