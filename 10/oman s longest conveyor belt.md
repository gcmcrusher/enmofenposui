## Magma 'conveyor belt' fuelled world's longest erupting supervolcanoes
Magma 'conveyor belt' fuelled world's longest erupting supervolcanoes. International research led by geologists from Curtin University has found that a volcanic province in the Indian Ocean was the world's most continuously active — erupting for 30 million years — fuelled by a constantly moving 'conveyor belt' of magma.

## Belt Conveyor 
The standard belt conveyor may be best for your application if: • You need a high conveying rate. • You need to convey over a very long distance. • Your plant has limited structure for supporting (or suspending) the conveyor. • A lower capital cost is more important than the conveyor's long-term operating and maintenance costs.
