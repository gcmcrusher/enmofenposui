It is shown that the bulk density of a coal stockpile can be readily estimated from the knowledge of the packing conditions of a coal loader. The equations for this purpose are formulated based on the results obtained from model experiments. The validity of these equations are checked by comparing the predictions with measurements of real

Surveyors will monitor these stockpiles and provide volumes for topsoil that is available. The method of monitoring these volumes depends on the resources, size and finances available at each mine. At some mines, surveyors will use lasers or RTK GPS and take points while walking over the stockpiles, while at others aerial photogrammetry is used.
