## Milling Machines 
A milling machine is a machine tool that cuts metal with a multiple-tooth cutting tool called a milling cutter. The workpiece is fastened to the milling machine table and is fed against the revolving milling cutter. The milling cutters can have cutting teeth on the periphery or sidesor both. The cutting teeth can be straight or spiral.

## Tree CNC Mill Quality 
14/12/. I had a Tree 325 from 1991 as my first cnc. Was a knee mill, weighed around 4500lb if I remember correctly. Had a Dynapath Delta 20 on it, 95' machine would have a newer control. IMO if your buying a cnc knee mill these will be some of the better heavier built machines. Mine had a Cat-40 Taper which was great.

The stop itself is a piece of 6 mm diameter silver steel, about 200 mm long. One end was turned with a 60 included angle for a point and the other was domed using files while the part was turning in the lathe. The remaining parts were made from 50 mm diameter aluminium bar and were relatively straightforward to make.
