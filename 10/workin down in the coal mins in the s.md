Crouched over the chutes, the boys sit hour after hour, picking out the pieces of slate and other refuse from the coal as it rushes past to the washers. From the cramped position they have to assume, most of them become more or less deformed and bent-backed like old men. When a boy has been working for some time and begins to get round

28/04/2016I take my metal dagger, and with the pommel, tap out on a rock in a dwarven morse code the name "KELIUM". And sure enough, I get the very subtle reply of "SOS". I reply with "MINE ENTRANCE" and they return with "MONASTERY". We find along a run-down side of the building a well-fortified door.

12/11/2014The melting glacier is a canary in the coal mine for global warming. Coal miners used to take canaries into coal mines with them. Canaries are more sensitive to dangerous gases than humans are. If the canary died, the miners knew there were dangerous gases present and would leave the mine. When he used the idiom, Kerry meant that the new report

## George Orwell: Down the Mine
23/11/2000When you go down a coal-mine it is important to try and get to the coal face when the 'fillers' are at work. This is not easy, because when the mine is working visitors are a nuisance and are not encouraged, but if you go at any other time, it is possible to come away with a totally wrong impression. On a Sunday, for instance, a mine seems

Mining is very unpleasant work, but the incessant background vocals (Workin' in a coal mine, oops, about to slip down) and Dorsey's enthusiastic delivery turned the song - about a guy who is so tired from work that he can't even have fun on Saturday - into a campy romp. An artist who didn't appreciate and enjoy real work couldn't have pulled it off, but Dorsey was the right man
