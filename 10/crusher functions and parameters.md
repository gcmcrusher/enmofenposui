## Difference Between Argument and Parameter
Key Difference – Argument vs Parameter A function is an organized set of statements to perform a specific task. Functions are useful in repeating a piece of code, so they provide code reusability.Programming languages such as C language consist of built-in functions like printf(). It is also possible to write functions by the programmer.

## Parameters In Impact Crusher That Affect Its Function
Here, we mainly introduce parameters in impact crusher that affects its function. 1. Diameter And Length Of Rotor. Generally, the diameter and length of rotor is related with the feeding size of raw material. While crushing the raw materials, we need enough impact force. In other words, the diameter and length of rotor should be proper.
