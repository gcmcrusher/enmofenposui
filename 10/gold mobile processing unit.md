For having multiple programs run at a time we have to use the multiple processor for executing multi processes at a time so we required another motherboard for that and that is very expensive.

## Efficiently optimise ore sorting • STEINERT
With preconcentration there are customers who can double the grade of their material. The STEINERT XSS T EVO 5.0 with 'dual energy' x-ray transmission (XRT) is ideally suited for ore sorting because the x-ray radiation can penetrate stones with particle sizes up to 100 mm. Metals can thus be detected, even when they are not on the surface.
