## What are the biggest concerns to the cement industry?
Taking the most votes, 'cost of energy' ranked as the main concern of 31% of respondents – perhaps no surprise given that power and fuel account for 25% of the costs of a cement operation. With much cement production still reliant on coal, the industry also remains sensitive to changes in the commodity market.
