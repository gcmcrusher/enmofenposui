Carbon emission sources in opencast mines mainly included fuel and explosive use, coal mine methane escape, coal and gangue spontaneous combustion, and electricity consumption. The carbon emission of the PMA increased from 4 10 4 Mg in 1986 to 1.05 10 6 Mg in 2015, with an average annual increase of 11.64%.

To achieve this, greenhouse gas emissions between 2010 and 2050 would need to be reduced by between 41%-72% for a 2C reduction and 78%-89% for a 1.5C reduction. In late 2020, however, Glencore became the first miner to pledge to achieve net-zero emissions including scope 3 emissions by 2050. Its CO₂ target includes a 40% reduction in
