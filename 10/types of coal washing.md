## Improvement of the Coal Ash Slagging Tendency by Coal Washing 
Coal with a high mullite concentration in ash is generally believed to have a high ash fusion temperature (AFT) and low slagging tendency. Conducted by a mineral transition mechanism at high temperature condition, this presented work investigates the improvement of the coal ash slagging tendency by coal washing and additive blending with mullite generation.
