## The working principle of ball mill 
22.05.201922 May, 2019. The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force. At a certain height, it will automatically

This process includes crushing (usually two-stage crushing, crushing, grading, packaging, transportation and hoisting). The ball mill can classify multiple classifiers in parallel, or connect the classification of multiple series products, and multiple grain sizes are produced. The ball mill and classifier form a closed-circuit circulation system.
