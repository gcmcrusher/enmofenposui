## Crushing in Mineral Processing
26/12/2015In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate

The 5 Lifecycle Stages of Mining. 1. Exploration Prospecting Stage. This is the first and most essential step of the mining process: in order to open a mine, companies must first find an economically sufficient amount of the deposit (an amount of ore or mineral that makes exploitation worthwhile.) Geologists are enlisted by the companies to

## Mineral Processing 
Mineral processing, mineral beneficiation, or upgradation involves handling three primary types of ROM material, which have been blasted, fragmented, and brought out from an in situ position. These materials can be used directly or by simple or complex processing and even by applying extractive metallurgy like hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical methods.
