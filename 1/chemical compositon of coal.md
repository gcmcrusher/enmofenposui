## The Chemical Composition of a Coal
05.10.2006Abstract. A coal-tar pitch has been analyzed by a variety of spectroscopic methods. The whole pitch was studied by elemental analysis, IR, 13 C and 1 H NMR as well as soft ionization MS techniques. The complex nature of the pitch was apparent from the MS studies and the "average" structure indicates that the pitch consists predominately of

While based on the chemical composition, generally the coal-biomass blends have a low tendency to slagging but have a high tendency to fouling. Coal-biomass blend at the coal composition of 85 wt% and PKS of 15 wt% (85-15) is recommended to be applied. The less the coal is used, the less the CO 2 emission, so it is expected to reduce the GHG
