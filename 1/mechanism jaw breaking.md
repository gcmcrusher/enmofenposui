The mechanism of movement of rocks down the crusher chamber determines the capacity of jaw crushers. The movement can be visualised as a succession of wedges (jaw angles) that reduce the size of particles progressively by compression until the smaller particles pass through the crusher in a continuous procession.

## Crime and conflicts in Africa: consequences of corruption?
With earthshaking and jaw-breaking levels of corruption in the African continent, the question on the extent to which corruption influences crime still remains unanswered. This paper assesses the effect of corruption (corruption-control) in 38 African countries using updated data. We find that, crime is highly positively (negatively) correlated with corruption (corruption-control).

Raffles is a 2-DOF (2 degree of freedom) figure. The mouth mechanism is mounted on a single bent flat piece which is then mounted on a second, larger servo. That piece extends beyond the servo horn to create the lower jaw holder. These pieces fill the head fairly well, so turning the large servo tilts the whole head.

## Four basic types of fracture mechanisms 
15.01.2020First, it is necessary to determine the fracture mode. Unfortunately, there is no clear or logical classification of fracture. Generally, classification is based on the crack growth mechanism. We will discuss four types of fracture mechanisms: ductile failure, brittle fracture, intergranular fracture, and fatigue.

As the hand wheel and draw bar is revolved, it draws the collet into the tapered adaptor, causing the collet to tighten on the workpieces. Figure 3: Collect chuck. The Jacob collect chuck has a wider range the spring collect chuck. Instead of a draw bar, it incorporates an impact-tightening hand wheel to close the collect on the workpiece.
