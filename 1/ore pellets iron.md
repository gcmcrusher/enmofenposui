Iron ore pellets are indurated, spheres of ore with a high iron content and uniform quality. Pellet plants can produce two varieties of pellets: blast furnace pellets and direct reduction pellets (DR pellets). Blast furnace pellets are used in the coke-based blast furnace process, which is the most common method of producing hot metal (molten iron for steelmaking). Blast furnace
