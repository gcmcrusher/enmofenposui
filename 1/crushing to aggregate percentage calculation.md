The aggregate crushing value (ACV) of an aggregate is the mass of material, expressed as a percentage of the test sample. which is crushed finer than a 2,36 mm sieve when a sample of aggregate passing the 13,2 mm and retained on the 9,50 mm sieve is subjected to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load of 400 kN. 2 APPARATUS

containing only about 2 percent plus No. 4 aggregate, the highest densities were ob tained with the heavy pneumatic-tired roller. In 1961 the field experiments were con tinued on three additional projects. Because all materials in the 1961 experiments were graded crushed stone, it was decided that only the vibrating roller would be used.

The aggregates crushing value test should be performed as per IS code 2386 Part IV. First, fill the sample aggregate with one-third of the cylindrical measure in three layers. Each layer should be tamped 25times freely. After filling the sample aggregate, weigh and record it as W1. Now fill the aggregate in the mould along with the plunger on top.
