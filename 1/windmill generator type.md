1.Wind turbine generator: Wind turbine generator produces electrical energy with the help of wind energy.It collects wind power from outside air and converts into electrical energy.Generally, two types of wind turbine are used. 1. Horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) 2. Vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) The blades of the turbine are placed horizontally or parallel to the ground is

## Working Principle of Wind Turbine Power Plant 
Horizontal axis wind turbine generators are being used all over the world successfully. The main components of a propeller type wind generator are shown in Figure. Usually, it has two of three blades made of high-density glass fiber reinforced plastic. The diameter of rotor ranges from 2 to 25 m. Modern rotors may be up to 100 m in diameter. Rotor blades are assembled on a hub.

22.11.2017Such a motor will have a high or very high motor constant compared to the majority of standard motors. Using a 24V or even higher voltage motor may help. If the motor/generator produces 24V at say 1000rpm it will generate 12V at a lower speed, say 500rpm and 500rpm might be nearer to the rpm your turbine can produce.

25.04.2022The U.S. government has also supported wind electricity production through incentives and other programs. Wind turbines convert wind power to mechanical power and then to electricity. The wind rotates the propellers of a wind turbine, and then the propellers cause the rotor—which has a main shaft connected to a generator—to spin.

## Modeling of Type 2 Wind Turbine Generators 
Modeling of Type 2 Wind Turbine Generators. While fixed-speed wind turbines are simple and robust, they have a significant disadvantage: they cannot optimally extract power from the wind. It would be preferable to have the generator continue to output rated power at high wind speeds. To achieve this, variable-speed wind turbines are employed.
