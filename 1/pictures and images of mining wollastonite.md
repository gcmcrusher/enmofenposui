Whiting supplies only CaO oxide to the glaze melt whereas wollasonite supplies both CaO and SiO 2. In addition, 1 gram of wollastonite does not supply the same amount of CaO as 1 gram of whiting.

Abstract. Wollastonite (CaSiO 3) is a vital mineral because of its utility in industry. It is a typical calc-silicate formed in skarn environments. Skarn is defined by its mineralogy, usually characterized by a calc-silicate assemblage of mainly garnet, pyroxene, and amphibole, besides wollastonite. In general, skarn is formed during regional
