## Roll Crusher Manufacturer Design 
Roll crushing surfaces operate at a fixed distance apart, as opposed to the continually changing distances in a jaw or cone crusher. This creates a more consistent product size. Roll crushers are low in profile and relatively easy to install. They can be fed with a minimum of headroom, or even choke fed. Adjustments are simple and internal parts are readily accessible. Applications
