## What is Electrochemical Grinding and How it Works? 
As per the name, it is the metal removal process which is nothing but the combination of the grinding process and electrochemical process. It is also termed as the "electrolytic grinding" and "anodic machining". In this technique, the workpiece plays the role of the anode while the grinding wheel works as a cathode.

Following the roughing process, steel grinding bring any component into a state of optimal shape or surface. During this phase, the exceeding material is eliminated by abrasion, thus ensuring an ideal finish. A high level of residual magnetism worsens the quality of the grinding and of the piece: the dust produced by the abrasion isn't removed, but remains on the piece, making the
