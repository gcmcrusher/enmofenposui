## 6 Essential Data Mining Techniques 
The sequential pattern is the most prominent data mining technique meant for evaluating sequential data with an aim to discover internal and external sequential patterns. It also involves Frequent patterns which are patterns (e.g., itemsets, subsequences, or substructures) that appear frequently in a data set.

for mining of patterns from sequence data, studied in literature. Apriori based methods and the pattern growth methods are the earliest and the most influential methods for sequential pattern mining. There is also a vertical format based method which works on a dual representation of the sequence database. Work has also been done for mining patterns with constraints, mining

A time series is a sequence of data points recorded at specific time points – most often in regular time intervals (seconds, hours, days, months etc.). Every organization generates a high volume of data every single day – be it sales figure, revenue, traffic, or operating cost.

## An Evolutionary Machine Learning Framework for Big Data Sequence Mining
Sequence classification is an important problem in many real-world applications. Unlike other machine learning data, there are no explicit features or signals in sequence data that can help traditional machine learning algorithms learn and predict from the data. Sequence data exhibits inter-relationships in the elements that are important in understanding and predicting future
