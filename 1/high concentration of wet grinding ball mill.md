## Ball Mill Explained 
If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills. Ball mills may be primary or secondary grinders. Primary grinders are fed from crushers such as a
