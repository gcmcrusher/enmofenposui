## Mullite Bricks
Mullite Refractory bricks have high refractoriness, which can reach above 1790℃. The starting temperature of load softening is 1600 ～ 1700℃. It has the good thermal shock resistance with cold crushing strength of 70 ～ 260MPa. There are two types of mullite refractories: sintered mullite bricks and fused mullite bricks.
