## Application of magnetic nanoparticles in nucleic acid detection
Wang first synthesized gold magnetic nanoparticles (AuMNPs) core–shell nanocomposite, then (NSP-DMAE-NHS) to hybridize. After the reaction is completed, unreacted impurities are removed by magnetic separation, then HNO 3 + H 2 O 2 and NaOH are added to trigger CL, and the luminous intensity is detected by a measuring system.
