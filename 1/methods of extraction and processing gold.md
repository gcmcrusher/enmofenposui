The effect of pH value on gold extraction for various ore types is shown in Figure 28.4. Greatly increasing pH value has a beneficial effect on gold extraction for both oxide and sulfide ores and stabilizes ∼pH 9.5–10.0, whereas for some carbonaceous ores, pH value has no apparent effect. However, the outcome will vary depending on the

Jun 21, 2022The basic process of gold extraction by resin pulp method is: #1. Adsorption: When the gold-containing cyanide solution passes through the exchange resin column, an ion exchange reaction occurs, and gold is adsorbed on the resin. #2. Desorption: The gold on the resin is desorbed into the solution with a desorbent.

## How Gold Is Mined 
The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity – known as dor – typically containing between 60-90% gold. During its life, a number of factors – such as the
