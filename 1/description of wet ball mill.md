## Enhancing the Electrochemical Performances by Wet Ball Milling 
04.05.2021The introduction of structural water in cathode materials of zinc-ion batteries can reduce electrostatic interactions to promote zinc-ion diffusion. However, it is difficult to introduce structural water in MnO2 cathodes due to annealing for crystallinity. For the first time, we introduce structural water into MnO2/graphite nanocomposites by simple wet ball milling of a
