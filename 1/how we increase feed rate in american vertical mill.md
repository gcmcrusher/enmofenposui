## Why Speed, Feed, and Depth of Cut are Important Factors
24.06.2021If using too high of a cutting speed or feed for a soft metal, the tool may end up removing too much in one pass. Cutting a hard metal at too low of a speed or feed rate may not provide the desired surface finish. One key aspect to keep in mind is that the tool's speed must increase when the hardness and strength of the metal increases.

## Feed Rate Calculation for the Rotary Axis 
The above formulas calculate the feed velocity for moving the rotary axis alone, not together with another axis. For example: Suppose that machining is done on the OD of a 1.5 diameter part, rotating the C-axis only. The tangential feed rate desired is 5 per minute. What is the required feed rate in degrees per minute? Answer: Feed rate

The end-point problem can be seen using the previous example if the original value is 489 and the new value is 402. This would make the calculation for the straight-line percent change formula (402 - 489) / 489.

Feed rate in drilling—Must be very low otherwise tool may break due to chip clogging. Typical value is 0.01 – 0.05mm/rev. Feed rate in milling—Usually 0.05 – 0.10mm/rev. Feed rate in knurling—0.5 – 1.0mm/rev (Cutting speed is usually very small in knurling but feed rate is very high). Pros and cons of improper feed rate

## Speeds and feeds 
Cutting speed. Cutting speed may be defined as the rate at the workpiece surface, irrespective of the machining operation used. A cutting speed for mild steel of 100 ft/min is the same whether it is the speed of the cutter passing over the workpiece, such as in a turning operation, or the speed of the cutter moving past a workpiece, such as in a milling operation.
