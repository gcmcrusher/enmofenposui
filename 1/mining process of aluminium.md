## Aluminium Refining Process
Aluminium Refining Process. Aluminium Refining Process- Electrolytic Process. In this process the oxygen in the alumina reacts with the carbon anodes and cathodes forming CO2 and aluminum. The alumina is conveyed from the storage silos and fed into an ore bin centrally located over the cell. The bin then supplies the cell with alumina as required.

## Mining and Refining 
Resourcing of research and development projects. Bauxite mining consumes a relatively small amount of energy (and consequently has low greenhouse gas emissions) compared to alumina refining and aluminium smelting processes. Diesel fuel and fuel oil combustion provides the bulk (95%) of the energy required to extract and haul the mined ore.
