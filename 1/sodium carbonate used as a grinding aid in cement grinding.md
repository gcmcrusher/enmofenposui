## Uses and Applications of Sodium Bicarbonate 
16/05/2011Sodium bicarbonate as a neutralizer. The reaction of acid with sodium bicarbonate is a common method for neutralizing acid spills. It is often used to increase pH and, therefore, the total alkalinity of swimming pools and spas. Sodium bicarbonate can be added as a simple solution that restores the pH balance in water with high levels of chlorine.
