## The Ironmaking Process 
The New Zealand Steel plant at Glenbrook is unusual in that the huge blast furnaces that dominate the processes at most steel works around the world are not present. This has eventuated because of the nature of the ore mined locally and used in the process. Early pioneering experiments failed to successfully smelt iron from New Zealand's west coast

## Glossary of Terms/ Definitions Commonly Used in Iron Steel 
Blending of Coal: Because of limited availability of good quality coking coal, the Indian Steel plants use a optimal Blend of the 3 or more varieties of coking coal to compensate for the lack of individual coals with the necessary properties. Another important consideration in selecting a coal blend is that it should not exert a high coke oven wall pressure and should contract sufficiently

## Frost Resistance of Coal Gangue Aggregate Concrete Modified by Steel 
06.05.2020Coal gangue, a by-product produced during the process of coal mining and washing, has a serious impact on the environment. Using coal gangue as a concrete aggregate has been proven helpful in potentially improving its value and reducing its environmental impact to a certain extent. However, the high water absorption and low strength of coal gangue

## Redefining Waste 
The company refers to solid wastes as "by-products", as this tends to make employees remember that unwanted materials have a value to the environment and the economy. The production of solid waste is inevitable in steelmaking. Each year, New Zealand Steel's Glenbrook Mill produces approximately 600,000 tonnes of waste.
