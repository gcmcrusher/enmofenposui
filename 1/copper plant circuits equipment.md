11.02.2019The biggest difference is that fiber optic cables can't carry electrical current like copper wires, so the new fiber optic equipment located in your home needs your electrical power to work. We'll install an initial 8-hour backup battery for your new fiber optic equipment, so your phone service will continue to work during a power outage.

## Electroless copper deposition 
So the first step is to deposit a conductive layer over the hole walls. We use electroless copper, that is we deposit chemically a layer of copper about 1 micron thick over the walls of the hole (and incidentally across the whole panel). This is a multi-stage process as you see from the video with washing steps between the stages.
