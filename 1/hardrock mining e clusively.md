## Production Schedule Optimisation in Underground Hard Rock Mining 
This paper reviews some general optimisation studies that have been proposed for underground hard rock mining. Furthermore, an example of a mixed integer programming model is presented for a small conceptual sublevel stoping operation. Comparative results of a schedule generated by a mixed integer programming (MIP) production scheduling model

## TRIBES AND HARDROCK MINING 
Hardrock mining has devastated tribal communi-ties. Many mines, such as the Zortman-Landusky mine, south of the Fort Belknap Indian Reserva-tion in north central Montana, and the silver, lead, and zinc mines of Idaho's Silver Valley, adjacent to the Coer d' Alene Reservation, polluted public water systems, poisoned fish and wildlife popula-
