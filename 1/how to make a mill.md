## How To Saw Logs into Lumber 
Similar to cant sawing, plain sawing begins with rotating and sawing the outer sides of a log into boards until the center is squared into a four-sided cant. Instead of leaving the cant as is, it is rotated and sawn to produce the maximum amount of lumber. If needed, the boards are then edged by sawing the rough edge off.

In case of a regular 3-axis mill, the use of different cutters makes the most sense. These can be dovetail cutters to produce angled grooves or just a mill with a conical cutting head for chamfering.
