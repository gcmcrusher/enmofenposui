316 and 316/L (UNS S31600 S31603) are molybdenum-bearing austenitic stainless steels. The 316/316L stainless steel bar, rod and wire alloy also offer higher creep, stress to rupture and tensile strength at elevated temperatures, in addition to excellent corrosion resistance and strength properties. 316/L refers to the lower carbon content to allow for greater corrosion

## Stainless Steel 
Mar 23, 2015This article is the third in a four-part series on the different types of steel. Read Part 1. The main alloying element in Stainless steels is chromium (typically between 10-20%). Stainless Steel is valued due to its high corrosion resistance. Stainless steel is about 200 times more resistant to corrosion than mild steel.

## Which steel is stronger: Cold rolled, hot rolled, or stainless?
What is minimum yield strength? Second is the hardness scale which uses the Rockwell scale which I've looked into a bit. The stainless rating for 304 is 88, but the rating for hot-rolled is B76. For cold-rolled, it seems to be broken into two: Hot rolled is B67-B80 and cold drawn is B80-B90.
