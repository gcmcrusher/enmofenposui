## Molybdenum 
Molybdenum is commonly used in the consumer, energy, industrial, medical, agricultural, aerospace, and transportation markets. The silvery-white, very hard metal has the sixth highest melting point of any metal and is often used to create high strength alloys and superalloys. When added to steel and cast irons, it improves strength, hardness and weldability, while also

## Molybdenum Mining 
Molybdenum (element #42, symbol Mo) is a metallic, lead-gray element, with a high melting point (4,730 degrees Fahrenheit). This is 2,000 degrees higher than the melting point of steel, and 1,000 degrees higher than the melting temperature of most rocks. Molybdenum was discovered by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1778, and was isolated and named by

## Copper
Molybdenum will float naturally with the copper but can be crowded in the froth by the copper mineralization and use of a moly collector (such as diesel oil, kerosene, refined oils, pine oil or xanthate ester) enhances its floatability. Further, because optimum moly flotation pH is at 7-8 while optimum copper selectivity is typically in the 9
