## Common Iron Ore Extraction Processes 
15/11/2019However, the concentrate grade of most weak magnetic iron ores is not high after the low strong magnetic separation process, and the unit processing capacity of the gravity separation process is low, so the combined process of strong magnetic separation and gravity separation is often adopted to the extraction of iron ore, that is, a large

Iron ore concentrate is produced from the magnetite iron ore in the beneficiation process and is used for the production of pellets for blast furnaces and sinter. The concentrates are non-toxic, non-flammable and non-explosive. The concentrate is shipped as a bulk commodity by rail using the open-top rolling stock and by sea. Manufacturer: SevGOK.

Fatma et al. (1999) studied the beneficiation of an iron ore sample containing 44% Fe, 1.59% SiO 2 and 20% BaO. By magnetic separation, two products of iron ore and barite concentrates were obtained by using a high intensity magnetic separator. The fine fraction (-0.125 mm) is about 20% by weight assaying 54.6% Fe, and 3.91%. Get More

## Performance assessment of an innovative precise low
Introduction. Iron ore resources are a significant material basis for the development of the steel industry. Currently, global steel production is predominantly supported by iron ore sources such as high-grade hematite, goethite, and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) deposits (Han et al., 2021, Xue et al., 2022).Although magnetite contains the highest iron content (72.4 %) than hematite and
