A Dynamic Mathematical Model of the Complete Grate/Kiln Iron-Ore Pellet Induration Process J.A. THURLBY Induration (drying and hardening) of iron ore pellets is an energy-intensive feed preparation step for both the blast furnace and direct reduction routes to iron. It is commonly carded out by a 'grate/kiln' process.

13.02.2020After all, if China is also building new coal power plants, then Australia isn't the only country still investing in coal. However, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) says that using China as the benchmark for new coal investments ignores the fact that its current coal generation of 1,100 gigawatts is running at less than half capacity on average.

## Effective Use of Available Heat for Maintaining a High Green Pellet 
In iron ore pellet production, an increased green pellet temperature has a positive influence on the straight grate induration furnace. Previous studies show that this can lead to both higher production capacity of the induration furnace and also reduced specific oil consumption. The aim of this study is to apply the process integration concept to analyze how to maintain a high
