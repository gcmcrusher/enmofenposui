## Wear Law and Parameter Optimization Study on the Split Cone 
13.07.2021During the sand-making process, the wear of the split cone will affect the dynamic balance of the rotor and the sand-making effect of the crusher. This paper focuses on experiments and simulations with the rotor of a vertical shaft impact crusher. A wear model for predicting the wear value of the split cone is established and its effectiveness is verified. The
