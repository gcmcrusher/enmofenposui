I also like to ball mill the mixture sans the metal to achieve homogeneity. However, note that milling for too long (more than an hour or so) will reduce the tail length and glitter delay significantly. Some like to keep 4-5 parts of the charcoal fairly coarse, 60-100 mesh which adds body to the non-glittering part of the tail.
