## Zircon 
Zircon is separated from heavy mineral concentrate at the mineral separation plants at Tronox's Chandala, KZN Sands and Namakwa Sands operations. Ceramics is the main application for zircon. The opacifying properties and whiteness together with abrasion and moisture resistance make it a key ingredient in ceramic tiles, sanitary ware and tableware. Zircon is also used

## Zircon 
Zircon is common in the crust of Earth. It occurs as a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks (as primary crystallization products), in metamorphic rocks and as detrital grains in sedimentary rocks. Large zircon crystals are rare. Their average size in granite rocks is about 0.1–0.3 mm (0.0039–0.0118 in), but they can also grow to sizes of several cm, especially in
