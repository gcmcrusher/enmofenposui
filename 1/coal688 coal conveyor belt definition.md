## Conveyor Belt Scale 
A typical conveyor belt scale or belt weigher system has a weigh bridge structure supported on load cells, an electronic integrator, and a belt speed sensor. The load cells measure the material weight on the belt, and send a signal to the integrator. The integrator also receives input in the form of electrical pulses from a belt speed sensor.
