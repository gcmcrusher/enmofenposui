Moreover, BSCs, gravel and sand have lower reflectance in the RE band (694–715 nm) than in other RE bands. Using the SWIR band (1538–1683 nm) as the numerator and the RE band (694–715 nm) as the denominator, the DRCI can amplify the difference between BSCs and other surface components, which causes BSCs to have higher DRCI values (mean = 1.77) than
