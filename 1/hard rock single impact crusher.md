## Impact Crusher 
Impact crushers (e.g., hammer mills and impact mills) employ sharp blows applied at high speed to free-falling rocks where comminution is by impact rather than compression. The moving parts are "beaters," which transfer some of their kinetic energy to the ore particles upon contact. Internal stresses created in the particles are often large enough to cause them to shatter.

This impact crusher achieves a high degree of reduction in size; for very fine end product sizes, however, we recommend installing a grinding track. Setting the gap is assisted hydraulically and thus easily adjustable. Depending on feed material and gap width, crushing capacity ranges of 110 t/h - 720 t/h are possible.
