## Concrete Mixes by Weight and Volume – SANS10400
30.07.2013We have had numerous requests for concrete mix ratios by weight, by volume, and by mass. Here is a table that was released by the Cement and Concrete Institute for trial concrete mixes from 10MPa to 40MPa. These are t rial mixes and should be used to test your concrete before it is used in any construction work.

## Mix Ratio of Sand
It is reported that, for traditional screeds a mix proportion of 1:6 Portland cement: sand/aggregate is a normal range that is commonly used. However, mix proportions of 1:4 cement to sand is widely applied which comply with British Standard (BS12). Mix ratio should produce a plastic, easy-working, cohesive mortar of plastering consistence.
