Abstract. The characteristics of Huimin high phosphorus limonite ore and the beneficiation of this iron ore by sodium-carbonate-added carbothermic reduction, ultrafine grinding and magnetic separation were investigated. Iron particle size in reduced ore without Na 2 CO 3 additive is tiny and the fayalite is abundant.
