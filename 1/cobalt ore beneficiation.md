It's difficult for the recovery rate to reach more than 60%, which causes a large amount of resource waste and a high cost of beneficiation. Because cobalt contains weak magnetism, and some of them are distributed in magnetic minerals such as iron ore at the form of isomorphism or mechanical inclusions in copper-cobalt ore, it's feasible to

19.11.20211. Cobalt ore smelting process . In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic, cobalt ore was mainly used as a raw material for the preparation of cobalt oxide. The process basically reduces the smelting of cobaltite ore into a cobalt iron by a blast furnace or an electric arc furnace. After annealing or roasting, the cobalt
