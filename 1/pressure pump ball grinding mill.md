## What Is A Grinder Pump: Here Is Everything To Know
Aug 28, 2021Grinder pumps pump the wastewater coming from a house situated below the main sewage line in the area. Since the main sewage is situated higher, the water from the house will not drain by gravity. So to remove the waster water, it needs to be pumped into the sewers. You can do this by using a sewage pump.
