## Wheat Milling Machine 
15.02.2022The milling process starts with cleaning the wheat and then sieving the grain. Once the kernels are cleaned, the bran is separated from the endosperm. This process improves the dough's colour and keepsake qualities. The germ contains oil, which is important in the making of bread, but is not essential. The coarse particles are then passed through fine rollers

## Overview of Wheat Flour 
However, it cannot compare with the whole wheat flour you get by milling your own hard red or soft white wheat berries. Large scale commercial flour producers, whose process involves separating the bran and the germ from the endosperm, simply blend back in some of the bran and germ and call this "whole wheat flour." The oils in the germ are removed, however, and most

## A Guide to Process of Wheat Flour Milling
Flour Milling. After fine pick, water and temperature condition, the wheat can be made bran, endosperm and malt separated to grinding operation. Rollers are used to release the endosperm. The opened grain then passes through a series of sieves to separate the finer grains. These finer grains are considered flour.

Roller milling is one of many methods used to produce flour. It is a process used to separate the anatomical parts of grain kernels —like the bran, aleurone layers, germ and endosperm—and grind them down into fine flour particles. The flour is then used in the production of bakery products, pasta, breakfast cereals, pet foods and snacks. 1.

Wheat is then grinded where it also undergoes various processes. After that, the wheat is then processed into flour. During processing, 15 small amounts of bleaching agents are added to the flour after milling so that the flour can be decolorized. The flour is then packed into various bags and sold to retailers and consumers.
