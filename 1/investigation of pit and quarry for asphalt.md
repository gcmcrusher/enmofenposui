Quarrying is quite simply the extraction of natural resources from the earth, usually from some form of surface working or quarry site. Quarries produce a range of useful materials, including limestone, dimension stone and rock. In Australia, the most common materials extracted are construction aggregates such as crushed rock, sand or gravel.
