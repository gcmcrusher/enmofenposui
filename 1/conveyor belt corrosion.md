## Conveyor Belting 
Conveyor belts have two basic components: the carcass, or strength member, and the rubber, which protects the carcass. Most conveyor belt carcasses are produced from fabrics that use polyester or nylon fibers, or a combination of the two. These fabrics are completely resistant to the deteriorating effects of moisture, and are resistant to most

## Corrosion resistance of conveyor belts (Journal Article) 
Abstract. Corrosion in the tensile member can lead to premature failure in conveyor belts. The extent of corrosion in terms of frequency of occurrence and volume is not exceptionally large in coal mining. Textile belts with synthetic fibre tensile members are virtually corrosion-proof and account for 86% of the belts below ground.
