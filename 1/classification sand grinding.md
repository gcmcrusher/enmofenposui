04.09.2012Grinding considerably increases the surface area into the range from 1000 to 5000 cm 2 /g, with an average particle size in a range from 16 to 4 μm. High-quality grades are produced by grinding sand in iron-free ball mills followed by classification controlled by a laser technique with Cilas-granulometers.

## Simulation for Particle Size Design and Scale
It is important to develop a technique to design particle size and to apply a scale-up method for the comminution and classification processes. In this study, a simulation was conducted by applying parameters of comminution kinetics and the partial classification efficiency equation to closed-circuit grinding process.
