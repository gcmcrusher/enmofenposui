Smaller scales of operation allows the use of inferior grade coke and iron ore (sinter usage is difficult). Mini blast furnaces are becoming increasingly as an economic and reliable source of iron for foundries as well as for forward integration with steelmaking units in EAF / EOF (and sometimes even small BOF) based steel plants.
