## Environmental Effects OF Quarrying 
Quarrying plays a vital part in the economic growth of the country. According to Cerilles (1999), nature is the primary provider in terms of resources and it has been observed that the economic development in a region lies on the resource extractive industries such as quarrying. It is recorded that from year 1985 until 1998, the average
