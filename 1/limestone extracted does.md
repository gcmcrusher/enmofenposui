## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? 
15/06/2008Answer. Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3). This is not very soluble, so rocks don't dissolve very quickly. But if you add an acid, you add hydrogen ions (H+), which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3- ions, which are very soluble in water, and the limestone will dissolve.

## Mineral Extraction 
Conclusion. Mineral extraction is associated with a diverse range of potentially adverse impacts on environmental and human health. A broad framework to assess potential direct and indirect risks is required, and must incorporate exposure information from geology, geomechanics, toxicology, and epidemiology.

## How Glass is Made 
The glass most people are familiar with is soda-lime glass, which is a combination of soda (also known as soda ash or washing soda), limestone, and sand. Although you can make glass simply by heating and then rapidly cooling silica, the manufacturing of soda-lime glass is a little more complex. By adding soda (sodium carbonate), the melting

## Limestone vs Granite: What Is the Difference? 
17/02/2022Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed of calcium carbonate. It makes up roughly 10% of the total volume of all sedimentary rocks on earth and is unique due to its composition of fossilized shell-producing and coral-building organisms. This natural rock is extracted either by blasting or mechanical excavation. Granite is quarried from all

## How Is Limestone Extracted 
How does limestone get extracted? Most limestone and dolomite are mined from open quarries although in many areas economic and environmental considerations favor large-scale production by underground mining. The basic elements of surface mining are overburden removal drilling blasting and hauling ore to the crushing and processing plant.
