## SAG Mill 
A SAG mill is characterized by its large diameter and short length. It rotates, tumbling its contents violently, causing a breaking action. The mill is lined with wear resistant steel liners which are fitted with lifters to assist with raising the load. The liners are replaced as they wear and the lifting action has degraded. The load - dry ore, steel balls and water - occupies approximately

SAG mill liner development draws primarily on practical experience from SAG milling operations supported by computer-based modeling of charge motion in SAG mills and on established good design practice. Liner design needs to respond to the process aspects of mill liner action that are critical to good SAG mill performance, i.e., the impact of shell liners on the grinding action

01.12.2012Highlights One-way coupled SPH–DEM models can predict the flow of solids and fluid charge in SAG mills. End walls and worn shell liners create significant axial flow and recirculation in a SAG mill charge. Slurry flow through the grate and along the pulp lifters and discharge from the mill can be predicted. End wall lifters are critical to grate flow producing
