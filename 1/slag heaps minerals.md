## Minimise slag heap disposal costs and recover valuable residues • 
Typically, heaps are left to accumulate until the available space runs out or until regulations require the operator to take measures to reduce them. Unfortunately, the material cannot be utilised economically with conventional processes, because the mineral content is far below the acceptable tolerances.

## Slag 
Slag is a by-product of smelting (pyrometallurgical) ores and used metals. Broadly, it can be classified as ferrous (by-products of processing iron and steel), ferroalloy (by-product of ferroalloy production) or non-ferrous/base metals (by-products of recovering non-ferrous materials like copper, nickel, zinc and phosphorus). Within these general categories, slags can be further
