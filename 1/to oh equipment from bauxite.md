## What Useful Material May Be Obtained From Bauxite
13.01.2022What can be made from bauxite? Bauxite refineries produce alumina (aluminum oxide) which is used to create aluminum metal. Bauxite is also used to manufacture other industrial products such as abrasives cement and chemicals.There are two operating bauxite refineries in the United States both of which are located in Louisiana.

## Red mud 
Red mud, now more frequently termed bauxite residue, is an industrial waste generated during the processing of bauxite into alumina using the Bayer process.It is composed of various oxide compounds, including the iron oxides which give its red colour. Over 95% of the alumina produced globally is through the Bayer process; for every tonne of alumina produced, approximately 1 to

## Silica Iron Separation from Bauxite 
Because the desired product is a high purity Al2O3, the remaining oxides in the bauxite (Fe2O3, SiO2, TiO2, Organic material) are separated from the Al2O3 and rejected as alumina refinery resides (ARR) or red mud. In general, the lower quality the bauxite (ie lower Al2O3 content) the more red mud is generated per ton of alumina product.
