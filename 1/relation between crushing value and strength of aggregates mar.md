Aggregate Testing For the Average Crushing Value (ACV), it was noted that the higher the value of the ACV number, the weaker the material. As expected, the ACV for HS RA was lower than the rest. The ACV for MS RA being lower than LS RA, thus concluding that the grade of the recycled aggregate affects the crushing capacity of the aggregate.

6. General Remarks. The specific gravity of aggregates normally used in construction ranges from about 2.5 to 3.0 with an average value of about 2.68. Specific gravity of aggregates is considered as an indication of strength. Material having higher Specific Gravity is generally considered as having higher strength.
