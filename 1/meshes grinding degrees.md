The main advantage of HGM micro powder grinding mill in processing high-fineness mineral powder is that the fineness can be adjusted freely, the fineness can be as high as 3000 mesh, and it can be freely adjusted between mesh. Therefore, the fineness requirement of 400 mesh-1250 mesh is only the middle value of the equipment adjustable fineness for the

Fine grinding produces a surface with little deformation that can easily be removed during polishing. Because of the drawbacks with grinding papers, alternative fine grinding composite surfaces are available, in order to improve and facilitate fine grinding, A high material removal rate is obtained by using grain sizes of 15, 9.0 and 6.0 m.
