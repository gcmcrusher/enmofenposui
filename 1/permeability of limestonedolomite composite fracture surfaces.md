There are more and more tunnel projects in the karst-developed areas in Southwest China. Affected by karst caves and water, karst tunnels often experience geological disasters such as local collapses and water inrush. A simplified rock stress hardening-softening model was established based on the triaxial compression test results of two kinds of carbonatite to

[8,10,11,13,15–20]. It is known that fracture surfaces can be approximated by self-afﬁne fractals [21–25], which means that the roughness of the fracture surfaces increases with the size of the fracture according to the scaling law determined by the fractal dimension of the fracture surfaces. Therefore, the permeability of a fracture with

The acid is injected at pressures lessthan the pressure that will cause the formation to fracture.

## Fracture Permeability 
Fracture permeability is divided into two types. The first type, referred to as intrinsic fracture permeability, only takes into account the conductivity of fracture for fluid flow, ignoring the condition of surrounding rocks. It is mainly affected by the fracture surface, the fluid flowing direction, and the intrinsic characteristics of fractures.

We take advantage of EA to overcome abrupt changes of permeability which its unpredictability prevents a machine to be learned. EA is also helpful for wells that suffer from core data. Second, fuzzy membership

This study develops a methodology for measuring the permeability of experimentally induced fracture surfaces in limestone-dolomite composite rocks. Cores of rocks from the Mount Head Formation and the Fairholme Group of southern Alberta were deformed at a confining pressure of 25 MPa in a triaxial rock press.
