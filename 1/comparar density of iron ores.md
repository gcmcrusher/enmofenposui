24.05.2016Beneficiation of Iron Ore and the treatment of magnetic iron taconites, stage grinding and wet magnetic separation is standard practice.This also applies to iron ores of the non-magnetic type which after a reducing roast are amenable to magnetic separation. All such plants are large tonnage operations treating up to 50,000 tons per day and ultimately requiring

## Mass, Weight, Density or Specific Gravity of Bulk Materials
As specific gravity is just a comparison, it can be applied across any units. The density of pure water is also 62.4 lbs/cu.ft (pounds per cubic foot) and if we know that ammonium nitrate has a sg of 0.73 then we can calculate that its density is 0.73 x 62.4 = 45.552 lbs/cu.ft. Note, kg/cu.m divided by 16.02 = lbs/cu.ft.

13.04.2019In order to investigate the density variation of iron ore particles during the in-flight reduction process, a modified empirical model was adopted for the density prediction. The estimation results show that the melting behaviour of the ore particles at high temperature results in a decrease in the particle density in the range from 6.64 to 15.00%.
