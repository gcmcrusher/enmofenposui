## An Experimental Study on Partial Replacement of Sand with Crushed 
Illangoan.R1 [2000] has done a study on100% replacement of sand by quarry dust in concrete. The compressive strength of concrete with quarry dust has 40%more strength than that of the concrete with sand. M. Shukla and A K Sachan2 (2000) studied environmental hazardous stone dust utilization in building construction.

Answer (1 of 8): Of course. Quite a standard procedure. We call it crusher dust, or manufactured sand. Dependent on the source rock and type of crusher, the particle shape is unlikely to be nice round grains, which makes for concrete that is not quite as nice to play with, but it is still far fr

## Effects of crushed stone dust on some properties of concrete
Crushed rock dust acts as a filler and helps to reduce the total voids content in concrete. Consequently, this contributes to improve the quality of concrete. In this research, some part of the sand replaced by crushed rock dust at amounts of up to 30 percent keeping all the other ingredients and proportions constant.
