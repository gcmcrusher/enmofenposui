## crushing grinding and flotation of nickel
Jan 01, 2014This is done by crushing and grinding the ores to liberate the nickel and cobaltbearing minerals from the other minerals. The ground ore is processed through two stages of flotation. The first stage of froth flotation separates the nickel, cobalt, and copperbearing minerals from the gangue rock and pyrrhotite.

## Comminution 
Comminution. Comminution till is defined as a 'very dense till that appears to have been formed by abrasion of bedrock and the crushing of detritus dragged along underneath the ice, accompanied by a mixing process that results in the incorporation of rock powder produced by abrasion at the till–rock interface into the overlying glacial load' (Elson, 1988).

## Separation of Copper
23/11/2018The separation of copper and nickel is achieved by differential flotation, if the mineral grains can be liberated by grinding. Normal practice is to depress the nickel sulfides by increasing the pH of the flotation pulp to between 9 and 11 and selectively floating the copper minerals.
