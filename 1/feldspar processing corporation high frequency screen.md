## Purified quartz and process for purifying quartz 
Quartz is purified by removing mineral impurities, particularly alkali metal impurities, from within the quartz crystal lattice structure. According to the disclosed process, quartz crystals are subjected to a pretreatment that removes surface bound impurities and then contacted with gaseous HCl at a temperature of from 800 C. to 1600 C. for a period of time of from a few
