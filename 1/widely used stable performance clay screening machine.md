## Revealing the numbers behind calcined clay 
One of the great benefits of calcined clay is that it activates at a much lower temperature than that required to make clinker. With temperatures of 750 – 850˚C instead of 1400 – 1500˚C and much lower costs for grinding and handling, you gain significant fuel and power savings – 30% and 40%, respectively – when comparing the operating cost to make 1 tonne of clay versus 1
