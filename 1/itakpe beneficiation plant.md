## what floculant use in iron ore beneficiation 
02.10.2020Feb 08, 2020 Cliff's Tilden plant in Cleveland, USA, is the only iron ore beneficiation plant, where selective flocculation technique, using degraded starch as the flocculant, has been applied to produce pellet grade concentrate from a feed containing around 32% Fe . The plant has a capacity of processing 10 million tons and is in operation since 1975.
