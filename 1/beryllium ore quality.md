## Beryllium 
Beryllium was only recently discovered by mankind; French chemist Louis-Nicholas Vauquelin first discovered Beryllium ore in 1798. In the days of Loius-Nicholas, tasting an element was necessary in categorizing and identifying it. Because Beryllium had a sweet taste like sugar when tasted, the element was first named glucinium. Beryllium remains highly toxic to humans, so
