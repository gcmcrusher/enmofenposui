## Grinding Mills and Their Types – IspatGuru
09.04.2015Stirred media mills are usually constructed in the form of a cylindrical drum inside which there are a series of rods, arms or perforated discs which are rotated on a central shaft. The drum is loaded with grinding media, such as metal balls or glass sand. The media and the charge is 'stirred' together and thus the grinding takes place.

## Grinding Medium 
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1–1.5 times the shell diameter ( Figure 8.11 ). The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20–40% water by weight.

## Ball Mills and Ball Charging 
Grinding is the process of achieving particle size reduction through attrition and compressive forces at the granular level. The grinding media in a ball mill is typically steel or ceramic balls of varying sizes, depending on the feed size, work index of the ore and the size reduction and distribution required in the discharge.
