Once the ore is on the surface, the process of getting the mineral you want out of the rock can start. Once the mineral is separated from the rest of the rock, the mineral needs to be cleaned so that it can be used. This process can be represented by the following flowchart diagram: In this chapter we will look at each of the steps in more detail.

## Why do we need beneficiation?
Beneficiation is the process where ore is reduced in size and gange separated from the ore. Since all iron ore deposits have unique mineralogy, the beneficiation process is specific to each deposit. What is a beneficiation plant? Beneficiation Plant means any plant or unit that is used for the purpose of processing of minerals to get rid of gangue, or to obtain a final product e.g.

## What is mean by concentration of ore?
concentration of ore means removal of impurities by physical methods. The impurities like sand, rocky materials, limestone, mica etc present in the ore is called gangue or matrix. Concentration is necessary as it is easy to extract a metal when the impurities are removed at the beginning. Then, what is concentration of ore Class 10?

## Ore 
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.
