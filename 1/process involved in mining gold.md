## Methods of Gold Mining 
Gold mining is the process of mining of gold or gold ores from the ground. There are several techniques and processes by which gold may be extracted from the earth. Placer mining. Placer mining is the technique by which gold that has accumulated in a placer deposit is extracted. Placer deposits are composed of relatively loose material that

Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of

## Prospecting and Mining Gold 
The entire process of gold mining can be broken down roughly into four steps: prospecting, mining, extracting and refining. Early discoveries of gold relied on the blind luck of someone spotting a yellow glint in a stream or in a crack between rocks. But the search today is more systematic and precise. First, geologists know more about how gold

## Mining Operation: Types, Impacts and Remedial Measures
Borehole process: Using a drill a deep hole is dug and a high pressure water-jet is used to force the materials up the hole. Sand, galena, gold etc. are mined by this process. Impacts of Mining: Mining is done to extract minerals from deep deposits in soil. Environmental damages caused by mining activities are as follows: 1.

## The Gold Smelting Process 
18.01.2017This is a chlorination process that refines gold to a purity of about 99.5%. The process involves blowing chlorine bubbles through molten gold which reacts with metallic impurities forming a chloride slag that is separate from pure gold and floats on top. Gold produced here is then cast into bars ready for the market.

## Cyanide Use in Gold Mining 
Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold. Partially due to cyanide, modern mines are. much larger than before cyanide was used; create vast open pits; and; produce huge quantities of waste. More than 20 tons of mine waste are generated to produce enough gold for a typical ring.

Apr 24 2014. Bioleaching, or microbial ore leaching, is a process used to extract metals from their ores using bacterial micro-organisms. The bacteria feed on nutrients in the minerals, causing the metal to separate from its ore. The metals commonly extracted using this process include gold, silver, zinc, copper, lead, arsenic, antimony, nickel
