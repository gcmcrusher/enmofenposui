## The Course of Ensuring Vibrating Screen Work Stably
The vibrating screen surface produce a certain frequency and amplitude by using exciting force, so the material on the oscillating screen surface moves continuously and uniformly. In the course of oscillating screen working, the speed of exciter device will be slow down and the oscillating screen bearing will be heat.
