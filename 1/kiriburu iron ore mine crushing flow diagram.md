## Iron Deposits 
11.08.2013Iron ore is mined and processed in the remote open-pit mine sites. After crushing and screening of the ore on site, the ore is carefully graded. There is sophisticated automatic sampling prior to shipping the ore via train to the port at Dampier over 1000km away, on the world's longest private railway. Ore is shipped directly to Asia and elsewhere from the major
