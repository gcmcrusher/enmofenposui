## How Is Ore Mined? 
When miners find rock containing mineral ore they first extract the rock from the earth. The rock is then crushed by powerful machinery. Metal is extracted from the crushed ore by one of two major methods: smelting or electrolysis.Smelting uses heat to separate the valuable metal from the rest of the ore.

Calcite-type fluorite ore is dominated by fluorite, and co-associated ores include calcite (30% or more) and a small amount of quartz, sometimes in the form of quartz-calcite-fluorite ore. Since fluorite and calcite are both calcium-containing salt minerals with similar solubility, both have strong adsorption operation when fatty acids are used as the collector.
