## Machining Delrin: A Complete Guide to Delrin CNC Machining
Delrin, also known as Polyoxymethylene (POM) or acetal homopolymer, is a semi-crystalline engineering thermoplastic. It is characterized by its low coefficient of friction, high tensile strength, high wearing resistance, and flexural modulus properties. It is generally manufactured using CNC machining or injection molding.
