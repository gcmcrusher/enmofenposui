## Machining Delrin: A Complete Guide to Delrin CNC Machining
Delrin, also known as Polyoxymethylene (POM) or acetal homopolymer, is a semi-crystalline engineering thermoplastic. It is characterized by its low coefficient of friction, high tensile strength, high wearing resistance, and flexural modulus properties. It is generally manufactured using CNC machining or injection molding.

## CNC Machining Milling Process 
The CNC milling process can be broken up into four distinct stages: CAD model design: engineers create a 2D or 3D design of the desired part. CAD model conversion to a CNC program: the design is exported into a compatible file format and converted into machine instructions using CAM software. CNC milling machine setup: the machine operator
