Grasses tend to tolerate acidic soils better than legumes, so liming to pH 5.5 may control acidity without limiting production. Legumes, however, need more calcium and perform best between pH 6.5 and 7.5: pH 6.0 to 7.0 is best for nutrient availability. Table 2 indicates the pHs preferred by common field crops.
