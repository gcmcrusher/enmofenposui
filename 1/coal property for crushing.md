## Selective Crushing of Run
To obtain commercial product of required quantitative and qualitative parameters, hard coal must be subjected to a number of processing operations. Preliminary stone removal from run-of-mine is one of them. Methods of such removal, including the method of selective crushing are described. Design solutions for a KOMAG-type device for dry stone removal of run-of-mine are presented.

## Fossil Energy Study Guide: 300 million years ago
When it is burned, coal makes heat and light energy. Th e cave men used coal for heating, and later for cooking. Burning coal was easier because coal burned longer than wood and, therefore, did not have to be collected as often. People began using coal in the 1800s to heat their homes. Trains and ships used coal for fuel.
