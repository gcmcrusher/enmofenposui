## Crushed concrete vs limestone for driveway 
24.10.2011One place does limestone, the other crushed concrete. The crushed concrete will run my about $5/ton less. With an estimated need of 45-50 tons, thats a pretty significant savings. I have a double drum roller which I plan to use to pack the new material into the existing drive to help smooth it and form a solid base.

Every 5 years I add a load of #1 crushed stone. In the spring I drag it with a pallet behind the zero turn mower and it looks great. It is very low maintenance.

11.03.2011Thanks. Dig out the grass, sterilize the soil, cover with about 6 of gravel. This should allow any moisture to drain and not allow an inviting base to attract insects. Easier than pouring concrete would be to put down a layer of weed stop fabric, then top with about 3 of crushed asphalt, concrete or crushed stone.
