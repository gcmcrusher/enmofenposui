## How to Estimate Concrete Costs? 
Calculation of Cost for 1m3 of Concrete. Let's consider the concrete mix of M15 (1:1.5:3), where, 1 is the part of cement, 1.5 is the part of fine aggregates and 3 is the part of coarse aggregates of maximum size of 20mm. The water-cement ratio required for mixing of concrete is taken as 0.45. 1. Assumptions:

Ans. INR 7537 is cost and rate analysis for 1 cum concrete of M15 (1:2:4). step 11 : rate per sq m for concrete m15, consider thickness of concrete structure is 150mm thick so Area of concrete structure in square metre = 1m3/0.15m = 6.67, 6.67 m2 concrete structure cost = INR 7537, so rate per sq m for concrete M15 = 7537/6.67 = INR 1130.
