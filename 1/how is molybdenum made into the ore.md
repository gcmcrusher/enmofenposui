01.11.20161. Introduction. The Jinduicheng molybdenum mine is located in Shanxi province and currently processes ores at over 30,000 t/d.Molybdenite concentrate is recovered as the main product in two stages; first, the bulk flotation concentrate of copper, lead and molybdenite is produced, and second, the molybdenum minerals are separated from other sulfide ores.

Technical molybdic oxide is made into briquettes that are fed directly into furnaces to make alloy steels and other foundry products. They also are used to make ferromolybdenum (see below ), but if more purified molybdenum products are desired, such as molybdenum chemicals or metallic molybdenum, then technical MoO 3 must be refined to chemically pure MoO 3 by

25.11.2017From molybdenum porphyry ores, over 90% of the molybdenum can be recovered by comminution and flotation; and from copper porphyry ores, the recovery of MoS 2 is lower, i.e. 30–60% due to the lower MoS 2 content in the ore. The general flow diagram for the concentrate of molybdenite from copper porphyry ores is shown in Fig. 18.1.
