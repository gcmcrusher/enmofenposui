In the Sungun Concentrator Plant, the crushed ore is fed into a semi-autogenous (SAG) mill to produce a product with a P80 = 3 mm. The SAG mill products are then transferred to the two ball mills, where the ore is ground to a level of P80 = 80 μm. Lime and collectors Z11 and AP407 are added to the ball mill feed as well.
