Silica: It exists in clay either as free or combined. As free sand, it is mechanically mixed with clay. In combine form, it exists in chemical composition with alumina. A good brick material should contain about 50% to 60% of silica. The presence of this constituent prevents cracking, shrinking and warping of raw bricks.

## Detail Classification of Bricks 
On the basis of raw materials bricks are of the following kinds: Burnt Clay Brick: It is obtained by pressing the clay in molds and fried and dried in kilns. It is the most used bricks. It requires plastering when used in construction works. Fly ash clay Brick: It is manufactured when fly ash and clay are molded in 1000 degree Celsius.

## Production process 
The drying process prepares the bricks for firing by extracting moisture from the soft green bricks. New and more efficient drying technologies such as the low-temperature dryer have reduced the drying period to one-third of the originally required time. Depending on the type of product, the drying period lasts between four and 45 hours.
