4 Nova CEO Christopher Gerteisen said the RPM deposit continued to deliver more thick intercepts of exceptionally high-grade gold. "These latest assay results confirm continuity and validate broad shallow zones of particularly high-grade gold mineralisation from surface within the much larger and broader RPM gold system," Mr Gerteisen said.

29.10.2014The Abitibi Belt, Canada. The Archean Superior Province of Canada contains the Abitibi greenstone belt, which contains some of the world's largest gold and copper-zinc deposits with significant amounts of nickel-copper-platinum group element (PGE) mineralization too. Discovered in 1909, the Abitibi has generated over 160 million ounces of gold.

The orogenic mineral system (Figure 2.7.1) unites a diverse group of mineral deposits that form during orogenesis, and include lode gold and Cobar-type Cu-Au-Zn-Pb-Ag deposits. These deposits form in response to major orogenic events caused by accretion or changes in subduction direction or dip. In many cases, the deposit form during short

## World Gold Deposits 
World's Largest Deposits of Gold. The massive deposits of the Witwatersrand mines in South Africa have produced more than 40 percent of the world's total production of gold.

## Orogenic gold deposit 
An orogenic gold deposit is a type of hydrothermal mineral deposit.More than 75% of the gold recovered by humans through history belongs to the class of orogenic gold deposits. Rock structure is the primary control of orogenic gold mineralization at all scales, as it controls both the transport and deposition processes of the mineralized fluids, creating structural pathways of
