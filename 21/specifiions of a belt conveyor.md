Slat Belt Conveyor. Slat conveyors are a type of conveying technology that uses a chain-driven loop of slats to move product from one of its ends to another. A motor drives the chain, which causes it to cycle just as belt conveyors do. Instead of a rubber belt, this conveyor type uses slats connected to a chain, providing a rigid, flat surface for every item on the conveyor.

In a cable belt conveyor system the driving and carrying mechanisms are separated. The driving forces are provided by two steel wire ropes (cables) and the material carrying medium is a rubber conveyor belt. These ropes are supported by grooved pulleys at regular intervals along each length. The belt rests on the ropes and is retained thereon

## Splicing of steel cord conveyor belts
Work disruptions must be avoided. The components of a steel cord conveyor belt splice: 1) Cover sheets. 2) (optional) Additional reinforcement embedded in unvulcanized core rubber. It is applied like a second core rubber sheet. 3) Core rubber sheets. 4) Steel cords with original core rubber. 5) Intermediate rubber strips.

The strength of the hot-vulcanized splice can reach 90-95% of the original belt. The layered fabric conveyor belt for coal mines can choose mechanical splicing, cold vulcanization and hot vulcanization according to the use environment and load. Steel cord conveyor belts can only choose thermal vulcanization splices.
