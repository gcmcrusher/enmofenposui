## How to Effectively Identify the Gold Ore? 
Identify gold ore by physical properties. （A）Tarnish: Gold nuggets or small pieces of gold are usually bright and free of stains. If you find some rust on the surface of the ore, it is likely to be pyrite. （B）Color: Most native gold is alloyed with silver, and if the silver content is high enough, the ore will have a whitish-yellow color.

## Investigation of the carbonaceous component of gold
A Directly coupled Evolved Gas Analysis System (DEGAS) was used to carry out a high-vacuum-hot extraction of the evolved gases using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Data on the organic component of the samples are obtained. The high sorption activity of the carbonaceous substance has a negative effect on the recovery of gold.

## Gold 
01/12/2021Gold-bearing quartz veins are often grouped into vein systems, which can cover areas of up to 150 square kilometres. Free gold is rarely found in unoxidised ores and gold may also be present as aurostibite (AuSb2). The dominant sulphides in epizonal orogenic gold deposits are usually arsenopyrite, pyrite and stibnite. The mineralogy of ores
