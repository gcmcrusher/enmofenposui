Coal is the most widely distributed fossil energy resource in the world. It is mainly divided into bituminous coal and anthracite, sub-bituminous coal and lignite. Sixty percent of the world's recoverable coal reserves are concentrated in the United States (25 percent), the former Soviet Union (23 percent) and China (12 percent). In addition

## Coal explained Coal prices and outlook 
19.10.2021Bituminous coal accounted for about 44% of U.S. coal production in 2020. Anthracite contains 86%–97% carbon and has a heating value that is slightly higher on average than bituminous coal. Anthracite is the least abundant rank of coal in the United States, and it generally accounts for less than 1% of annual U.S. coal production.

Anthracite is a high-rank coal, representing a coal that has been subjected to the highest grade of metamorphism. Anthracite is shiny black, hard and brittle (see Figure 2.8) and has the highest fixed-carbon content (approximately 86–98%).Due to its low volatile matter (2–12%), anthracite's combustion process is slow. Most anthracites have low-moisture content (about 3–6%) and
