## how gravimetric feeder measures weight in coal feeding
gravimetric coal feeder calibration procedure. The Gravimetric Feeder compensates for the variation in bulk density by feeding a fixed weight of coal in response to a boiler demand. This ability to accurately weigh the coal on an as-fired basis provides significant improvement over volumetric feeders in terms of matching the BTU delivered by
