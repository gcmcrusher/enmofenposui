Data extracted from AME's global mine database reveals that between 2005 and 2017, the average grade of copper ore mined declined from 0.74% to 0.59%. This represents a 1.8% CAGR decline. Sulphide ore extracted from open-pit mines and processed to concentrate accounts for an estimated 62% of total ore mined in 2017.

The highest ore copper content is normally around 3-4%, which means that bioleaching takes place in the presence of a high percentage of materials that vary widely from one ore deposit to another. Some of these materials can interfere with the process inhibiting the microbial activity or modifying the required acidity of the leach liquor. Particle ores can differ also in their

Copper Ore Processing Methods. The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining, concentrating, smelting, and refining. In a few instances, however, leaching takes the place of concentrating, smelting, and refining.

early commercial operations of copper bioleaching of low-grade ores are shown in Table 3. Currently, heaps are widely used in the large-scale bioleaching of copper. They are employed for processing low-grade ores non apt for concentration and smelting or as an alternative to smelting when the overall economy of the process is favourable.

## The Impacts of Copper Mining in Chile 
It is also true that the copper extraction process is more diicult and expensive now, due to lower ore grades, rock hardness and greater hauling distance required, among other factors. For instance, the average copper ore grade in Chilean deposits has changed. In 2007, 0.87 metric tons of copper were extracted from 100
