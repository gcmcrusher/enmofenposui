Aluminum production first begins with smelters extracting aluminum from bauxite (sedimentary rock) during a two-step aluminum smelting process. The Bayer process separates alumina from bauxite. Also known as aluminum oxide, alumina then undergoes the Hall-Hroult process, producing pure aluminum. Each step decreases material quantity by half.

Melting, or fusion, is a physical process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a solid to a liquid.This occurs when the internal energy of the solid increases, typically by the application of heat or pressure, which increases the substance's temperature to the melting point.At the melting point, the ordering of ions or molecules in the solid breaks down to a less

In 1861, Ure described the smelting processes used in Swansea. The predominant ores were cupreous pyrites and "gangue" (iron ore or rock), containing nearly equal parts of sulphide of copper and sulphide of iron. The processes were described as follows: 1. Calcination of the ore. The ores from various mines are mixed into a consistent
