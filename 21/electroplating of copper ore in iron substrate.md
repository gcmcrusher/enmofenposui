## Business Ideas 
Electroplating is the process of depositing metal ions onto a substrate's surface. The metal ions are eliminated from the substrate during electropolishing, resulting in a smooth, streamlined surface texture. This is done by immersing the object in an electrolyte bath, allowing it to function as an anode. ELECTROLESS PLATING:

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining Extraction
The barren rock, or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore. By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper, iron and sometimes other metals. Such ores originate from sulfur-bearing volcanic magmas, which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.

## How electroplating works 
30.10.2021T here's no such thing as alchemy—magically changing common chemical elements into rare and valuable ones—but electroplating is possibly the next best thing. The idea is to use electricity to coat a relatively mundane metal, such as copper, with a thin layer of another, more precious metal, such as gold or silver. Electroplating has lots of other uses, besides making

This is due to the low solubility of iron in copper and silver generally found in typical bullion - where the amount of these diluents is low, the iron causes less significant or negligible problems. Furthermore if the mint applies the modern practice of induction melting, the melt tends to spit due to atmospheric oxidation of hot iron-rich modules being carried to the surface by convection.

Digging with bone tools, they excavated huge quantities of copper ore from the Rudna Glava (Ore Head) in what is now present day Serbia. The settlers at this time were foremost agrarian, concerned in animal husbandry, hunting and foraging from the Neolithic Vinča culture that survived from 5700–4500 BC.

Copper, Bronze and Brass Stainless Steel. Stainless steel is a metal alloy, made up of steel mixed with elements such as chromium, nickel, molybdenum, silicon, aluminium, and carbon. Iron mixed with carbon to produce steel is the main component of stainless steel. Chromium is added to make it resistant to rust.

## Types of Metal Plating: Metal, Types, Applications, and Benefits
Metal plating is a process where a thin layer of metal coating is applied on the surface, or on the substrate of a metal part, product, or component. The process of metal plating can consist of electroplating, which makes a deposition of metal ions on the surface of the substrate by making use of an electric current.

like nickel is applied before gold plating on the substrate of copper as nickel atoms do not defuse to good. Some metal may also be gold plated to improve their aesthetic value for ornamental purpose. Chrome Plating Chrome plating is a finishing treatment given to a metal surface using electrolytic deposition of chromium (chromium plating).

Another use of electroplating is to purify copper on an industrial scale for use in electrical wiring: the cathode is pure copper the anode is impure copper, produced from copper ore USA An improved method for the electroless plating of metals is accomplished by a sustainable direct metal-metal ion displacement reaction on porous metal surfaces.

Electroplating is a surface treatment. The material being coated is made the cathode and placed in the electroplating solution or bath. Baths are often aqueous solutions of their salts. Aluminum is an exception which is plated on a semi commercial scale from organic electrolytes.

26.01.2007Thanks. BTW, steel is commonly plated with copper as a base for other plating. For instance triple chrome plating refers to one layer of copper, one layer of nickel, and a top layer of chrome. Anyway, here's a definition I found online. I Included the definition of Monel also, since it's been an alloy discussed repeatedly on this forum.

## A Brief Guide to Copper plating 
20.10.2016The copper plating process involves electroplating, whereby an electric current is used to deposit a layer of copper onto a base metal. Many metals can have copper plating, including silver, aluminium, gold and plastic. Any iron based metals will need a nickel base coat as copper does not easily plate onto a passivated surface.
