## 25.3 Crushing and milling 
We will discuss the extraction of iron from iron ore as an example. Extraction of iron. Iron atoms are found in the compounds FeO, Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 and in rocks like haematite and magnetite. South Africa is the seventh largest producer of iron ore in the world. Iron has been mined in South Africa for thousands of years.

Iron ore crushing. The extracted iron ore will be transported to the primary crusher. Over-sized and wet ore will be sent to the ROM stockpile for pre-treatment before it is sent to the primary crusher. Primary and secondary crushing followed by screening will result in lumps and fines sized between -32mm +8mm and -8mm respectively.

## Iron Ore 
Iron ore minerals, particularly hematite and goethite, are beneficiated by a combination of size fraction, preconcentration, and flotation in stages (Fig. 13.45).Iron ore requires removal of silicate impurities of a finer size by flotation for higher-grade products of +60% Fe. ROM ore at 400–600 mm is fed to a primary crusher with product set at –40 mm.
