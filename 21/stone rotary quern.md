Rotary Hand Quern As the name implies, the rotary quern used circular motions to grind the material, meaning both the quern and the handstone were generally circular. The handstone of a rotary quern is much heavier than that of saddle quern and provides the necessary weight for the grinding of unmalted grain into flour.

## Mill Stone Rotary Quern
15.10.2021A rotary quern stone is a 'machine' with a mill stone sitting on top of a furrowed 'bed' stone. The pattern in the lower stone collects the ground material. Over the years I have carved many examples using designs copied from ancient querns during my visits to museums where I handled and studied the subtleties of the design and tool marks.

A rotary quern is a type of quern formed from two circular stones, an upper stone that sits on top of a lower stone. Grain was poured into a hole (the feeder pipe) in the upper stone, which was then rotated to grind the grain. Eight rotary quern stones were found at Clachtoll Broch and many of these showed signs of having been very well-used.
