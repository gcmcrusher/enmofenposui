## Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) Systems 
Description. Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is a proven and effective physical/chemical technology for treating a variety of industrial and municipal process and wastewater streams. DAF systems are commonly used for the removal of oils greases and suspended solids to meet a variety of treatment goals including: Product recovery and reuse.

When the vacuum disc filter working, the filter disc circles clockwise in the slurry tank. With the help of different pressure generated by vacuum pump, the particles are absorbed on the cloth of the disc and forming a filter cake with a certain thickness. Mixer rotation prevent solids' precipitation at the same time. When the cake leaves from the liquid surface of slurry tank, the

20/04/2020The filtering operation is not performed in the Spark cluster. So you only need to use a cluster that can handle the size of the filtered dataset. Partition filters. Data lakes can be partitioned on disk with partitionBy. If the data lake is partitioned, Spark can use PartitionFilters, as long as the filter is using the partition key.
