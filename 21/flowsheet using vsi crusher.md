Twister VSI crushers use two variations of VSI crushing. The first is vertical shaft impact crushing where rock is fed onto a table type rotor which accelerates and then discharges the rock at high speed against steel anvils in the crushing chamber. The impact of the rock against the steel anvils induces fracture and breaks the rock.
