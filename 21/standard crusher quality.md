## Cone Crushers 
A Cone Crusher will deliver a 4:1 to 6:1 reduction ratio. As we set the closed side setting tighter to create a finer output, we also reduce the volume or throughput capacity of the machine. Generally speaking, multiplying the closed side setting by two is a good guide to the top size of the gradation exiting the machine. A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the

04.05.2020Let's go through the 5 levels of quality standards, from most basic to most advanced. 1. The golden sample.

## Statistics: how does standard deviation measure quality 
In this case, the larger the standard deviation is, the lower the quality of your manufacturing process. This is regardless of the actual standards you need to meet - if process A has higher standard deviation than process B, than for any tolerance interval $pm a$ mm, process A will generate more bad products than process B. Now, the second use of standard deviation, (2)
