## How can we reduce concrete's hefty carbon footprint? 
The process of creating cement emits upwards of 80 percent of the cement's weight in carbon dioxide and accounts for about 5 percent of human-generated CO 2 emissions annually. Though the white block's production still requires some of the CO 2 -emitting fuel use of typical cement making, CO 2 is also one of the ingredients used to create it.

## Analysis of Energy
Cement is one of the most commonly used building materials in the construction industry. Because of its many advantages, cement concrete has become an indispensable material in the construction industry, which further improves the importance of cement. At present, the cement production process in China is relatively backward. Some areas still use the traditional

## More sustainability for the cement industry 
This is because the higher the proportion of clinker, the more CO 2 is released during cement production. The polysius activated clay technology developed by thyssenkrupp makes it possible to reduce CO 2 emissions from cement production by up to 40 percent. Part of the cement clinker is replaced by calcined, i.e. thermally activated, clay.

05.12.2020The European cement industry has actively worked on reducing emissions for a long time. Since 1990, it has reduced its CO2 relative emissions by about 15%. CEMBUREAU elaborated a Roadmap in 2013 setting an 80% CO2 reduction target for 2050. The Roadmap was complemented in 2018 by the "5C approach" that promotes a collaborative approach

## Cement production CO2 capture technology 
Cement is the world's leading construction material — but it's also one of the key drivers of climate change, responsible for around 8% of global CO 2 emissions. Carbon capture is a vital technology to decarbonise cement manufacture, as up to 70% of CO 2 emissions come from the chemical process of calcining calcium carbonate—which can't be achieved with other methods.
