## Best Fertilizer For Alkaline Soil 
The gypsum is an inexpensive, fast-acting fertilizer that can help revive Alkaline soil. If you have soil that is highly alkaline or hardpan, gypsum can break down compacted soil and increase nutrient absorption. However, gypsum can also remove essential nutrients from the soil, causing poor plant growth.

## The Use of Gypsum and Lime on Lawns and Gardens
21.07.2000Lime and gypsum are valuable soil amendments in certain areas of the United States. Many gardeners in the eastern U.S. apply lime to their soils to improve plant performance. Gypsum can help overcome problems associated with sodic soils in arid regions of the west. In Iowa, however, the addition of lime to gardens and lawns is often unnecessary. Gypsum

## What kind of soil is treated with gypsum to make it suitable for
SOLUTION. Alkaline soils are treated with gypsum to make it suitable for cropping. Alkaline soils are clay soils with high pH ( 9), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Gypsum is calcium sulfate anhydride; it is a rich source of calcium. Gypsum stabilizes soil by binding it to the organic matter present in the clay.

Soils of this type may also have quite a high pH but still be low in calcium, whilst alkali soils with high sodium or magnesium levels will reduce plant, crop or turf production. Correct applications of Gypsum can result in such soils returning to high levels of productivity via an ion exchange that dramatically improves soil friability and tilth.
