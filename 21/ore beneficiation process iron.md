## What is the Beneficiation Process? 
01.10.2014Oct 1 2014. The beneficiation process can be defined as a treatment process of ore which results in a more concentrated form of the product. It is often used in the preparation of iron ore for smelting. This is an essential process as it helps improve the yield from a deposit of ore, thereby increasing the potential profits that can be obtained

## Iron Ore Beneficiation Technology By Electrostatic Separation
Almost 100% of mined iron ore is used in steel production, making it essential for everything from staples to buildings. Beneficiation is the term for reducing the size of valuable iron ore particles and separating them from the gange (unusable minerals), which are then discarded. There are several different methods of wet and dry separation.
