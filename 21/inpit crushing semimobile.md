08/09/2016In-pit crushing and conveying (IPCC) is generally applied in three configurations: fully mobile, semi-mobile and stationary. In fully mobile systems, shovels/excavators feed the fully mobile crushing plant directly and trucks are confined to a clean-up fleet. Crushers are mounted on tracks and move with shovels.
