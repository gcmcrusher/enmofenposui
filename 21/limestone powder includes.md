## Powder rheology :: Anton Paar Wiki
Powder rheology. Powders are used in many industries as raw material, intermediate or final products. But working with powders can be difficult, as their behavior is influenced by a large variety of different parameters. Powder behavior can change during manufacturing due to changes in the powder or in ambient conditions.

## Effects of particle
The performance requirement may include ease of placement and compaction without segregation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of fineness of limestone powders and particle-size distribution on the performance of self-compacting high performance concrete for stabilizing the production of the concrete.

## Calcium Carbonate Powder ( Calcite Powder LimeStone Powder )
Uncoated calcium carbonate is a white, odorless powder that is used in a variety of industries. It is made by grinding natural limestone or marble into a very fine powder. This powder can be used to make products that include paint, paper, plastics, and rubber. It is also used in the food industry as a dietary supplement and to fortify foods

## Limestone – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand
Limestone, a sedimentary rock abundant in New Zealand, consists mainly of the bones and shells of tiny marine fossils made of lime (calcium carbonate). Rocks with more than 50% calcium carbonate are considered to be limestone. Most New Zealand limestone deposits formed in the Oligocene and Miocene periods, 5–37 million years ago.
