## Foundry Sand Types
Foundry Sand Types. According to the different binders, foundry sand used for moulding can be divided into green sand, water glass sand and resin sand. Clay sand is the mixture of natural silica sand, clay, additives and water. The clay used to make wet clay sand is bentonite clay. The compressive strength is generally 0.05 to 0.1 Mpa.

## The challenges in the choice of molding material for sand casting
So-called raw sand is used for the mold because it mostly contains quartz, which has a high melting point of 1713 Celsius and a high hardness. These characteristics make raw sand well suited for casting thanks to its high wear resistance and high temperature resistance. When selecting raw sand, the amount of quartz should be as high as possible.

## Sand Casting: Construction, Types, Applications, and Advantages
Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. Casting materials include metal, concrete, epoxy, plaster, and clay. This article will focus on sand casting. The versatility of the sand casting process is well recognized.

## Centrifugal Scalping of Sand Improves Metal Casting Results
The foundry also realizes a 5 percent labor savings and a similar rise in productivity from reduced grinding of castings and less sieving of sand for foreign matter and lumps. The improvements stem from the CENTRI-SIFTER centrifugal separator from Kason Corporation, which sifts the recycled sand to as fine as beach sand, according to Leroy Martz, Cast Rite Metal co-owner.
