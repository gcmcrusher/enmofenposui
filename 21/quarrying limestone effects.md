## Limestone quarry, quarrying, cement raw materials
Quarrying. Most of the raw materials used are extracted from the earth through mining and quarrying and can be divided into the following groups: lime (calcareous), silica (siliceous), alumina (argillaceous), and iron (ferriferous). Since a form of calcium carbonate, usually limestone, is the predominant raw material, most plants are situated

## What is Quarrying?
Quarrying is the process of removing rock, sand, gravel or other minerals from the ground in order to use them to produce materials for construction or other uses. So, a quarry is any such working on the surface of the earth where minerals are extracted. Quarries are also known by other names around the world: 'surface mine', 'pit', 'open

Over the past century, quarrying has become more prominent in the British Isles; however, there has been little focus on the effects of water quality from potential added quarry discharge, especially in the Yorkshire Dales. This research will aim to provide detailed water quality analysis whilst exploring reasons behind the effects of the Horton Quarry in the Yorkshire Dales.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Quarrying 
Quarrying was first used by early settlers in Britain for building stone and extracting metals for weapons. It continues as an industry that involves the extraction of rocks like limestone and slate.

## THE EFFECT OF QUARRYING ACTIVITIES ON THE ENVIRONMENT 
Quarrying activity provides much of the materials used in traditional hard flooring, such as granite, limestone, marble, sandstone, slate and even just clay to make ceramic tiles. However, like many other man-made activities (anthropogenic factors), quarrying activities cause significant impact on the environment (Okafor, 2016). In particular, it is often necessary to
