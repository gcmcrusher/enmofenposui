## Using condensing and modulating boilers to increase operating efficiency
01.11.2008Modulation refers to a boiler's ability to match firing rate — input — to meet the heating demand — output — of the system. Modulating boilers offer turndown ratios of 3:1, 4:1, 5:1 — even as high as 20:1 — to operate at less than 100% input. For example, a 1 million BTU-per-hour boiler with 20:1 turndown can operate at just 5% of

## Operational allocation of coal 
Operational Allocation is the process for allocating additional coal exploration areas to existing coal exploration licence, assessment or mining lease holders to avoid sterilisation of coal resources, supporting better mine design or extending the life of a mine. The Operation Allocation Framework is outlined in the Guidelines for coal

## Boiler Turndown Ratio: What It Is and Why It Matters
A boiler turndown ratio refers to the ratio between a boiler's highest fire setting (maximum output) and lowest fire setting (minimum output). Turndown ratios vary depending on the boiler. For example, if your boiler has a 3:1 turndown ratio, that means that at its lowest fire setting you will be operating at 33% of the boiler's full capacity.

In GE, we usually referred to combined cycle as those applications that used the gas turbine waste heat to produce steam for driving a steam turbine that in turn drives a generator to produce electricity. Where the gas turbine waste heat was used for other purposes (like steam to process in a refinery), we called it cogeneration.

## Supercritical coal plant 
Supercritical coal plants are a type of coal-fired power plant used in more modern designs. They differ from traditional coal power plants because the water running through it works as a supercritical fluid, meaning it is neither a liquid or a gas.This occurs when water reaches its critical point under high pressures and temperatures, specifically at 22 MPa and 374 o C.
