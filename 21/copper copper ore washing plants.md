The smelting of copper sulfide ores in Cyprus lasted for more than 3500 years and produced more than 200 000 tons of copper metal. Many with an output of 300 000 tons per annum of blister copper. The plant consists of an IsaSmelt furnace, a matte-settling electric furnace, four Peirce–Smith converters and two
