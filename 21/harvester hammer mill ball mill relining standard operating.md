## Prosecutions undertaken 
The system of work being operated by the Accused was the relining of Ball Mill 3 at the Mine, including removing shell liners from the ball mill. The practicable measure the Accused failed to take on 11 July 2012 was to ensure Mr Mostert did not work or stand in close proximity to an unsecured shell liner on the inside of the ball mill shell.
