## Coal mining 
In room-and-pillar mining, coal deposits are mined by cutting a network of 'rooms' into the coal seam and leaving behind 'pillars' of coal to support the roof of the mine. These pillars can be up to 40% of the total coal in the seam – although this coal can sometimes be recovered at a later stage. Longwall. When is this method used?

15 ELUTION BEHAVIOUR OF METALS FROM CARBON 475 Introduction Gold can be extracted industrially from ores by a variety of processes, and one of the most successful methods is the carbon-in-pulp (CIP) process. In CIP processing, ore is mined, ground, and leached with alkaline cyanidic solution to solubilize the gold as a gold cyanide complex.

Operation of the electrowinning process differs depending on the elution procedure that is used. In the case of Zadra elution, where the electrowinning cell is in series with the elution column, the column and cell must be designed to elute and recover the gold by recirculation of the eluant until the gold content of the eluted carbon is low enough (100 g/t) to be reactivated and
