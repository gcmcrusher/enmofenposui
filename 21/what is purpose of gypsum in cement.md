INTRODUCTION. The purpose of this review is to summarize information related to hexavalent chromium, Cr (VI), in the portland cement industry. The catalyst for initiating this project was the content restrictions and labeling/marketing of cements based on the level of Cr (VI) in cement in Europe, and the potential for a similar situation in North America in the near future.
