11.01.2021Belt Conveyors. While belt conveyors have a higher capacity per horsepower than augers, they tend to be limited by the shallow angles of incline, steep costs, and extra floor space they require. By comparison to an auger system, belt conveyors are more gentle and will result in less grain damage.

## How Does a Conveyor Belt Work? 
18/01/2022How Conveyor Belt Systems Work. In a typical conveyor belt system, a belt forms a closed loop and stretches across two or more pulleys. This enables it to rotate continually. One of the pulleys (the drive pulley) moves the items from one place to another. While traditional conveyor belt systems are straight, some units require turns to deliver
