The Pros and Cons of Each. Electroporation is less cumbersome than chemical transformation and generally gives higher transformation efficiencies (measured in colonies formed per microgram of DNA). However, it is more expensive. It requires a specialized apparatus to deliver the charge and cuvettes to transfer the charge to the cell suspension.
