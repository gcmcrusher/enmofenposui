## Using Borax Flux to Refine Gold 
07.08.2013With some borax, heat, and a little know-how, it's possible to extract pure gold from a sample of ore. This is because using borax as the flux reduces the melting point of all the elements in a piece of ore, including gold. While out in the field, a gold prospector can grind and wash a piece of ore, then mix it with borax in a plastic bag.

20.05.2022Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander. Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

## How Is Gold Processed? 
29.03.2020Gold is processed by cyanide milling, a chemical procedure that separates 95 to 98 percent of the gold from raw mined ore. It is then refined to the gold standard purity, according to Mineweb. Heap leaching is a less expensive method of gold extraction, but it is a longer process and it recovers less gold than the cyanide milling process.

## How Gold Is Mined 
Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity – known as dor – typically containing between 60-90% gold.
