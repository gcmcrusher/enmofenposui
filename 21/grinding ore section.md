The beneficiation practice shows that in each grinding section, the grinding ratio has a suitable value, and the grinding ratio of the conventional ball milling section is generally about 80-100. An excessively large primary grinding ratio is uneconomical. The grinding efficiency is low, the energy consumption is high, and the product is easily crushed, which affects the sorting effect
