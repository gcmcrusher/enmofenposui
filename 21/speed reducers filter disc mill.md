05/07/2020A vibration mill is a size reduction equipment that applies the process of continuous impaction in carrying out its size reduction function. The grinding container is made up of a tube that is held in a frame that is supported by means of springs which is filled to approximately 80% total volume with porcelain or stainless steel balls.

## A New Design of a Two
08/08/2011A traditional two-stage cycloidal speed reducer is obtained by the simple combination of single-stage cycloidal speed reducers. A single-stage reducer engages two identical cycloid discs in order to balance dynamical loads and to obtain uniform load distribution. Consequently, the traditional two-stage reducer has four cycloid discs, in total.

Due to the cycloidal disc design, the reduction components run as a smooth, rolling motion to prevent tooth breakage typical in conventional gearing. The result is a durable solution with a renown, long-lasting gear drive that includes: Minimal vibration. 500% Momentary shock-load capacity. Low backlash and extended operational life.
