## The Sediment
Sediment-hosted stratiform copper deposits comprise disseminated to veinlet Cu and Cu-Fe sulfides in siliciclastic or dolomitic sedimentary rocks. Sediment-hosted stratiform copper deposits are extremely common though economically significant deposits are rare. They account for approximately 23 percent of the world's Cu production and known reserves in addition to

## Dolomite 
Dolomite is used as an ornamental stone, a concrete aggregate, and a magnesium oxide source, as well as in the Pidgeon magnesium production process. It is a significant petroleum reservoir rock that also serves as the host rock for massive strata-bound MVT ore deposits of base metals including lead, zinc, and copper.

Host rocks comprise two types: calcareous or dolomitic siltstone, shale, and carbonate rocks of marine or lacustrine origin; and non marine sandstone, arkose, and conglomerate. Cobalt concentrations in the Aynak copper ores that contain cobaltite is in the range from thousands of per cent to 0.3 wt. percent cobalt.
