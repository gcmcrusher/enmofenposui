## Bauxite beneficiation method 
For example, in the beneficiation process of gibbsite kaolinite bauxite, it is often used to separate mud and sand first, remove iron by magnetic separation after coarse grinding, and flotation after slime grinding. The flotation reagent is prepared with oleic acid, tar oil and engine oil in a ratio of 1:1:1.

Abstract In this study, extraction of aluminum-, iron-, and titanium-bearing constituents from diaspore-type bauxite ores was investigated by stepwise treatment consisting of pre-desilication via alkali-leaching of bauxite ore, extraction of alumina via Bayer process, and recovery of iron from red mud via magnetic separation

## Handling of bauxite 
One of the major sources of air pollution is oil combustion for power generation and alumina calcining. Two other environmental impacts of great concern is dust and caustic soda contamination. The particularly small size of both raw bauxite and alumina very often affect areas downwind of mining, transport, calcining, and ship loading operations.
