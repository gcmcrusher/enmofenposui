The name is taken from the drawings of American cartoonist Rube Goldberg (1883–1970), which had a ridiculously complicated sequence of events to do something as trivial as giving someone a back scrub. Obviously, this is different from a traditional invention in that it gives a complicated solution to a simple problem, not the other way around.
