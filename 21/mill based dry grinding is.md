## Dry Milling 
Dry milling (Fig. 7.1) involves grinding the incoming grain, then processing it through a series of steps to liquefy the flour and generate fermentable sugars. Amylases are added at two points in the process—the initial slurry step, and the liquefaction step, which follows a jet cooking operation that uses high-temperature steam to swell the starch. Following liquefaction, the slurry is fed
