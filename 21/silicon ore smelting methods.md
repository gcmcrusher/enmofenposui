## How To Smelt Metals At Home 
And, oddly enough, if you bake either one in a special way at around 2000F, like a phoenix from the weathered copper ashes, you get copper. We call this special process smelting. Malachite is an ore of copper, and you can smelt copper by baking ground malachite. Copper Ore. There are a couple of issues to clarify before we try, however.

## lead ore smelting method
Jun 24, 2020 Methods ranged from primitive open-hearth arrangements (essentially bonfires on which lead ore was piled) to blast furnaces capable of continuous operation. [12] In the USA there are 400 forgotten lead smelting firms that operated in the 1930s to 1960s and may have deposited dangerous levels of lead contamination in nearby soil.

Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc. Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals, e.g. iron, because in contrast, zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals, zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost, unless

Smelting Process. It is mainly a three-stage reduction-converting-atomizing process. Mined ore is crushed to size and fed to the DC furnace together with coke and fluxes and heated to 1600˚C to reduce the iron and vanadium to metal, producing a vanadium-bearing Iron melt, with 65% TiO2-rich slag (Product). get price.
