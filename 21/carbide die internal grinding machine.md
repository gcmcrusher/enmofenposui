Inside diameter grinding is an extremely versatile technique, and we use best practices to complete every project. We use a combination of longitudinal and plunge grinding if the grinding wheel needs to be narrower than the surface being machined. In most cases, the diameter of the grinding wheel stays between 2/3 and 4/5 of the bore diameter.
