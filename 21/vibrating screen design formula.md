Traditional designs of vibrating screens have a uniform field of amplitude over the entire surface of the sorting surface generally. Thus, the oscillation amplitude has the same value over the entire sieving surface, or a constant value in each point of the sieving surface. This phenomenon poses a number of problems of sorting of bulk materials

## 8 Principles of Screen Design in 2020 (with Examples) 
01.10.2019During the screen design process, the best method for writing is similar to the one in the case of drawing: we need to make sketches first. In other words, you should write down at least 6-8 versions of the copy. If we are ready with that, we need to choose the best. It is worth spending time on formulating the text. The best results usually come out from melting the
