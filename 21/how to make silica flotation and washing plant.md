The float glass process involves floating a glass ribbon on a bath of molten tin and creates a smooth surface naturally. Floating is possible because the density of a typical soda-lime-silica glass (~2.3 g/cm 3) is much less than that of tin (~6.5 g/cm 3) at the process temperature.

07.07.2019However, silica sand is currently being mined and'washed from the St. Peter only in LaSalle and Ogle Counties. In these areas, the formation varies from 140 to over 200 feet thick. It is mined only to a maximum depth of about 90 feet, due to water problems and increasing iron content at depth. All of the mining is done by open-pit methods.
