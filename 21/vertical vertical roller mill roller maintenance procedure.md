The power ingesting of a grinding process is 50-60% in the cement production power consumption. The Vertical Roller Mill (VRM) reduces the power consumption for cement grinding approximately 30-40% associated with other grinding mills. The process variables in cement grinding process using VRM are strongly nonlinear and having large time delay
