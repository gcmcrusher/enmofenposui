Scrap metal and iron ore are melted with very hot electrodes (about 1,650 degrees Celsius). Oxygen blown into the furnace during the process removes impurities from the hot metal. The molten steel is then tapped into a ladle furnace where additives are mixed in to refine the composition of the steel and give it certain properties.

## The mining history of the Sudbury area 
For it was in August of that year that Thomas Flanagan, a blacksmith on the Canadian Pacific Railway, noticed a rust coloured patch of rock while working with a crew in a recently blasted rock cut north-west of present-day Sudbury. Mining in the area actually began long before Thomas Flanagan –at least 10,000 years before.

## Cyanide hazards to plants and animals from gold mining and
Cyanide extraction of gold through milling of high-grade ores and heap leaching of low-grade ores requires cycling of millions of liters of alkaline water containing high concentrations of potentially toxic sodium cyanide (NaCN), free cyanide, and metal-cyanide complexes. Some milling operations result in tailings ponds of 150 ha and larger.

## DRI production 
DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state, i.e. without melting, as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen, coming from reformed natural gas, syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

## Uranium mines and mills 
Uranium mines and mills. Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element used for fuel in nuclear power reactors. Canada is one of the world's largest uranium producers. The majority of Canada's production is exported. Uranium is mined to provide uranium ore which is processed at a milling facility to produce uranium concentrate.
