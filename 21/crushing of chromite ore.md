01.01.2013Chromite ore is exclusively found in ultramafic igneous rocks. Major associated gangue minerals are talc, quartz, serpentine and iron oxides.Chromite is a heavy mineral, with a specific gravity in the range of 4-5, relative to associated gangue minerals in a chromite ore, which makes gravity concentration a suitable process.
