US History. The large-scale mining of copper had its origins in the late 1800's, primarily in the American West. Small mines existed around the country, particularly in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and in Arizona, but they were able to extract copper only from high-grade ores. The development of efficient flotation processes around the

The room and pillar method of mining is employed in all salt mines in Michigan, Ohio, and Ontario. The rooms vary in width from 30 to 60 ft and in height from approximately 17 to 40 ft. Pillar size is adjusted so that the extraction or recovery will attain a maximum of 70%. Actual mining is confined completely to the salt bed.
