Barite is ubiquitous and known to incorporate 226Ra through the formation of a solid-solution. In U mining mill tailings, barite is one of the dominant sulfate-binding minerals. In such environments, sequential extractions are generally used to identify the U- and 226Ra-binding phases and their associated reactivity. To better decipher the main processes governing the
