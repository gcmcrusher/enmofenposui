## Dynamic Design of Belt Conveyors 
underground mining as well as material handling, belt conveyors are used to move massive volumes of minerals and overburden material. Belt conveyors become increasingly powerful. Whereas only 20 years ago, developing a 300m long 1000tph belt conveyor was quite a challenge, todays systems are capable of moving 20.000tph over 10km and more. Especially

## How Do Conveyor Belts Work? 
A conveyor belt works by using two motorized pulleys that loop over a long stretch of thick, durable material. When motors in the pulleys operate at the same speed and spin in the same direction, the belt moves between the two. If objects are particularly heavy or bulky — or if the conveyor belt is carrying them for a long distance or

## Conveyor systems 
Sorter conveyors often use polyester/nylon fabric known as EP fabric (SME, 2011). Different variations of the belt conveyor have been conceived to deal with challenges unique to certain environments. These variations common to the mining industry include the gravity conveyor, cable belt, pipe conveyor, and sandwich conveyor/apron conveyor.
