## CNC Router Bits: Up Cut End Mills 
Up cut end mills are great for all standard milling and material removal. These end mills for wood pull the wood chips up and away from the tool path which helps prevent tool breakage and extends the life of the bit. If a particular finish is required for your project, use a down cut or compression cut end mill for the final pass.

## Introduction to the Mill 
End mills are designed for cutting slots, keyways and pockets. Two fluted end mills can be used to plunge into work like a drill. End mills with more than two flutes should not be plunged into the work. Ball end mills can produce a fillet. Formed milling cutters can be used to produce a variety of features including round edges.

Step 1: The Design and CAD Model. It all started with a proper design, in my case a few sketches to get a good feeling for the dimensions and shape. Quickly after the sketching phase came the CAD model. I created my model in SolidWorks. If you plan to design your own machine I recommend a parametric CAD-modeling tool.

## Down milling vs. up milling 
Down milling. In down milling (climb milling), the cutting tool is fed with the direction of rotation. Down milling is always the preferred method wherever the machine tool, fixture and workpiece will allow. In peripheral down milling, the chip thickness will decrease from the start of cut, gradually reaching zero at the end of cut.
