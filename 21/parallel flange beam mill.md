## Cellular Beams 
WESTOK CELLULAR BEAM. Cellular beams are the modern form of the traditional Castellated Beam. Westok cellular beams comprise a beam formed by profiling a rolled section using our patented, semi-circular dual pass process. The two tees are separated by half a pitch and the beam is welded back together.

## Steel Beams Basics 
First, wide flange steel beam has parallel flanges while S-shaped I beam has tapered flanges which have a slope on the inside surface. Second, for the wide flange beam, the width of web and flange is almost equal, while for the S beam, the flange is a lot narrower than the web. Third, as a result of the differences above, their mechanical
