Gold Recovery Process. For gold recovery, water and a cyanide such as calcium cyanide, sodium cyanide, or potassium cyanide, are added to ore or scraps to form a slurry. The gold will leach out and mix with the cyanide into a solution. Activated carbon is then used to separate and store the gold, which is removed as the final step of the process.

A process for adsorbing gold from a leach pulp by means of activated carbon is described in which the leach pulp (the leach solution together with the subdivided gold bearing ore) is diluted to a specific gravity of less than that of the activated carbon and is subsequently passed upwardly through a multistage liquid/solid contacting column.

## Method of desorbing gold from activated carbon 
Gold in the form of its cyanide complex is desorbed from activated carbon by contacting the carbon with a stripping liquid at temperatures above that 130C but below the decomposition temperature of the gold cyanide complex. The stripping liquid may comprise water, dilute caustic or dilute caustic cyanide.

## Comparison of activated carbon and ion
Abstract The use of activated carbon and ion-exchange resins for recovering copper cyanide from gold leach solutions is compared in detail. When using activated carbon, the overall cyanide-to-copper ratio should be reduced to ∼ 2 to achieve the most effective adsorption. This can be accomplished by dissolving metallic copper into the leach solution.
