History of cement. The origin of hydraulic cements goes back to ancient Greece and Rome.The materials used were lime and a volcanic ash that slowly reacted with it in the presence of water to form a hard mass. This formed the cementing material of the Roman mortars and concretes of more than 2,000 years ago and of subsequent construction work in western Europe.

Wider than a single-disc concrete grinder, they allow the operator to cover a larger area in a shorter time. If your outside space is more than 1,500 square feet, you might want to think about getting a dual-disc system. A single-disc concrete grinder is more suited for smaller jobs, such as fixing a damaged walkway in the front yard.

## Cement Types
What are the differences in these cement types and how are they tested, produced, and identified in practice? In the most general sense, portland cement is produced by heating sources of lime, iron, silica, and alumina to clinkering temperature (2,500 to 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit) in a rotating kiln, then grinding the clinker to a fine powder.
