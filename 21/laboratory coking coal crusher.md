19.05.2004Coal-derived components appear in the oil fraction from coal−resid reactions at 465 C. This reaction temperature represents a "coke jump", in which the yield of solid, as a function of temperature, increases dramatically. This behavior is not observed when the individual feedstocks are reacted alone. Further evidence for coal−petroleum interactions in this system is exhibited
