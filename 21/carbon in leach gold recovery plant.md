gold extraction plants. In the carbon-in-pulp process adsorption occurs after the leaching cascade section of the plant, and in the carbon-in-leach process leaching and adsorption occur simultaneously. In both processes the activated carbon is moved from one tank to another in countercurrent with the ore pulp until the recovery of the loaded carbon in the first tank. This

## Estimating process design gold extraction, leach residence time 
01.05.2015Plant design parameters for gold extraction, leach residence time and cyanide consumption are generally determined from standard bench-scale bottle roll or agitation leach tests. The application of laboratory data to process design has essentially evolved from the testing of oxide or low cyanide-consuming ores. Such scale-up factors may not be appropriate for
