Large 0.5 to 2.0 cubic meter samples were processed on the author's testing sluiceand in the UAF laboratory. Average gold recovery for all operations except three sites was over 99% of gravity recoverable gold (Section 13). These results confirmed the earlier more conservative gold recovery estimates derived from radiotracer testing.
