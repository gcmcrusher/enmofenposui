## Understanding Rolling Process in Long Product Rolling Mill
27.11.2015If a mill rolls 80 % of the calendar year, that is 365 x 24 x 0.80 = 7008 hours. If the mill rolls 800,000 tons per year, it runs at an average production rate of 114.16 tons/hour. If the utilization can be improved by 1 %, the available rolling hours is 365 x 24 x 0.81 = 7096.6, creating 87.6 extra rolling hours.
