Flotation of low grade nickel sulfide ores into a concentrate suitable for smelting, and at acceptable nickel recovery, can be challenging. Alteration of the gangue minerals can mean talc is present in considerable quantities. Talc floats naturally and can be very difficult to depress without significant nickel losses. High talc bearing ores have often been considered untreatable.
