magnetic separation. The first stage of slag processing is crushing and sc reening the feed material to fractions of 0-4 and 4-22 mm. Coarser fractio ns are handled by a heavy media separation - the DWP-method. A magnet separator and spiral washing are used for fine-grained material. The recovered alloy of 0-4 and 4-22 mm are saleable products.
