## Flagstone 
Flagstone is a form of sandstone derived from sedimentary rock split from layers along a bedding plane. This is why the rock is typically in similar thicknesses and large flat surfaces. We source our Flagstone from quarries located right here in Georgia as well as from surrounding states of Tennessee, North Carolina but even as far away as Arizona.
