The successful design of a conveyor belt for bulk material handling begins with an accurate appraisal of the characteristics of the material to be transported. The behavior of bulk materials greatly depends on the moisture content and particle size distribution of the material. Wide variations in material behavior and bulk density with moisture and particle size can lead to
