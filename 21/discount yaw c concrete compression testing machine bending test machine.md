Flexural strength is one measure of the tensile strength of concrete. It is a measure of an un-reinforced concrete beam or slab to resist failure in bending. It is measured by loading 6 x 6-inch (150 x 150 mm) concrete beams with a span length of at least three times the depth. The flexural strength is expressed as Modulus of Rupture (MR) in

## Unconfined Compression Test 
The Unconfined Compression Test is a laboratory test used to derive the Unconfirmed Compressive Strength (UCS) of a rock specimen. Unconfirmed Compressive Strength (UCS) stands for the maximum axial compressive stress that a specimen can bear under zero confining stress. Due to the fact that stress is applied along the longitudinal axis, the
