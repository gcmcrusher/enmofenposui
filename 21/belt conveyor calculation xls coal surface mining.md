06.09.2020Aiming at the problem of belt conveyor damage caused by the presence of foreign objects on the belt conveyor in coal mines, this paper proposed that video detection of foreign objects on the belt surface was performed based on SSD. Improvements on SSD network are made from following aspects. Firstly, the deep separable convolution method is used to reduce
