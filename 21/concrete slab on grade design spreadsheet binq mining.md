## Chapter 5. Concrete Design and Construction Details 
Floor Slab Design Floors are designed as slabs on grade. The slab thickness depends on the type of loads on the floor slab. In most cases, the slab thickness is designed as an unreinforced concrete section. Reinforcing is added to control shrinkage cracking and maximize the distance between designed joints. Floor performance is influenced by:

## Concrete slab floors 
Concrete slab floors suit many home designs and, when combined with appropriate passive design, can provide thermal comfort and reduce energy use. Concrete slabs offer high thermal mass. Thermal mass is useful in most climates, particularly cool climates and those with a high day-night temperature difference. A concrete slab floor provides a simple way to add thermal
