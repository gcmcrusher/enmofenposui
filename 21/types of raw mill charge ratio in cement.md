18.03.2020Sulfate resistance. Lower C 3 A contents in cement correspond to increased sulfate resistance. Therefore, Type II cement, which is intended for moderate sulfate resistance, is allowed a maximum C 3 A content of 8%. Similarly, Type V cement, which is intended for high sulfate resistance, is allowed a C 3 A content no greater than 5%.
