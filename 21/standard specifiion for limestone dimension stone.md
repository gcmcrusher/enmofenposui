## The Importance of Testing When Specifying Natural Stone
ASTM C170: Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of Dimension Stone. This test is used to measure a stone's resistance to crushing. It requires cubic or cylindrical specimens that measure between 2 and 3 inches in all dimensions. A ram is used to apply pressure to the stone until it fails or "smashes.".
