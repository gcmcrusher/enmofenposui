## Grinding Calcite Grinding Mill
17.09.2019Calcite is a common calcium carbonate mineral, which is easy to grind its 3 Mohs hardness. It can be used as a raw material in the silicate industry. Generally, the grinding of calcite requires a large grid of finished products, i.e., an extreme grinding fineness is required. Thus, the ultra-fine grinding machine is commonly used for calcite grinding.
