Crushers that utilize shear forces to achieve the desired size and shape reduce material by trimming or cleaving. Material trapped between a solid plate and a rotating roll is shorn by its contact with the teeth on the roll. Oftentimes, shear crushing is combined with other crushing methods, such as compression, attrition and impact, for mineral size reduction.
