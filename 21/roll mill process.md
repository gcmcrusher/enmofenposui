## The influence of rolling mill process parameters on roll thermal 
23.01.2019This study analyzes the impact of operational parameters of hot rolling mill in the degradation process of a roll surface by thermal fatigue. A methodology was developed to determine a coefficient that could identify when operational parameters become crucial to initiate this degradation process. This new coefficient, named the surface damage coefficient (κ), is

2.3 Roller Mills. A combination of cutting, attrition, and crushing occurs in roller mills. These are smooth or corrugated rolls rotating at the same speed set at a pre-determined distance apart with material passing between the two. A tearing action may be added by operating the rolls at different speeds and by corrugations which are different

## Roller Milling 
Roller milling is one of many methods used to produce flour. It is a process used to separate the anatomical parts of grain kernels —like the bran, aleurone layers, germ and endosperm—and grind them down into fine flour particles. The flour is then used in the production of bakery products, pasta, breakfast cereals, pet foods and snacks. 1.
