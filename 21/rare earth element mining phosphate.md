## Scientists Just Found a Way to Extract Rare
05.03.2019The trick is using organic acids produced by bacteria to do the hard work of extracting rare earth elements (REEs) from phosphogypsum. The researchers tried a number of bio-acid mixtures of mineral and organic acids to extract six REEs – yttrium, cerium, neodymium, samarium, europium and ytterbium.

Geochemical and mineral-specific REY signatures may, therefore, have utility for distinguishing the impacts of biota on soil weathering processes on early Earth. The development of such signatures may be mitigated, in part, by accessory mineral composition, the types and concentration of LMWOAs present, and precipitation of secondary minerals.

With the diminishing of easily accessible minerals for mining, the REE recovery from waste is an alternative toward a circular economy. Present methods for REE recovery suffer from lengthy purifications, low extractability, and high wastewater streams.
