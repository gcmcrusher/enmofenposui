General Weights. Solid rock is estimated at 2.5 to 3tons per cubic meter. If rock is crushed into uniform sizes, the presence of open space between the particles causes the load to be lighter -- approximately 1.6 tons per cubic meter. Mixed sizes of crushed rock can range from 1.6 to 2.2 tons per cubic meter. Read More

## Cubic Meter 
A cubic meter is equal to 1000 liter (one thousand liter). It is represented by the symbol m 3 or meter cube. Cubic meter is an SI unit of volume, when a cube has length equal to 1 meter. Since a cube has all its sides equal, therefore the volume of cube is equal to: V = length x breadth x width. V = 1m x 1m x 1m. V = 1 m 3 or 1 cubic meter
