## 2002 Sustainability Report of Alcoa Inc. 
Alcoa uses bauxite, lime, caustic soda, aluminum fluoride, carbon, and several other materials to produce aluminum. The requirements for these materials depend on the initial quality of the bauxite and the process technologies used to convert the materials. In general, approximately two tons of bauxite is required to produce a ton of aluminum oxide, and approximately two tons of

## Aluminium Fluoride 
Aluminium fluoride is used in turning alumina into aluminium. It lowers the melting point of alumina and boosts its electrical conductivity. It is also used in the preparation of white enamels, as an anti-reflection coating in complex optical systems, as a constituent in welding fluxes, and in the preparation of fluorine containing glasses.

02.12.2007In 1858 he patented a method for making the extraction of alumina (Al 2 O 3) from mineral bauxite more cost-effective. These efforts introduced aluminum to the world by lowering its price to a level that allowed ordinary people to afford aluminum jewelry. (The 1859 price for a pound of aluminum was around $17, about the same as silver.)

## Aluminum Production 
05.02.2011According to the worldwide average, 2.3 tons of bauxite is necessary to produce 1 ton of alumina. Primary aluminum is produced via the Hall–Hroult process, a process of electrolytic reduction in a molten bath of natural and synthetic cryolite. Two tons of alumina is necessary to produce 1 ton of primary aluminum.

There are three main grades of non-metallurgical bauxite. Abrasive-grade bauxite, used to produce abrasives; Chemical-grade bauxite, used to produce aluminium chemicals; and. Refractory-grade bauxite, used to produce high alumina refractories. Their characteristic chemical compositions of each grade of non-metallurgical bauxite are outlined below.

## Aluminium Fluoride 
The majority of aluminum fluoride is created by treating alumina with hydrogen fluoride at 700C: fluorosilicic acid can also be used to create aluminum fluoride. H 2 SiF 6 + Al 2 O 3 + 3 H 2 O → 2 AlF 3 + SiO 2 + 4 H 2 O. It can also be produced through the thermal decomposition of ammonium hexafluoroaluminate.
