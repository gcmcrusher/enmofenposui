## Mechanism Analysis and Spatial
Abstract: Based on the statistics and analysis of a large number of documents, the spatial-temporal characteristics of shallow coal seam surface subsidence under fully-mechanized coal mining （fully-mechanized top-coal caving）are summarized, and the mechanism of surface movement is explored. The results show that, when the depth-thickness ratio is less than 40,

## Surface Soil Moisture Inversion and Distribution Based on Spatio 
10.08.2022Soil moisture plays an important role in hydrology, climate, agriculture, and ecology, and remote sensing is one of the most important tools for estimating the soil moisture over large areas. Soil moisture, which is calculated by remote sensing inversion, is affected by the uneven distribution of vegetation and therefore the results cannot accurately reflect the spatial

01/12/1998Spatial and temporal variability in soil biotic populations reflect heterogeneity in soil resources, affect patterns of soil process rates, and facilitate coexistence of diverse biota. We investigated these relationships in a 0.7-ha restored riparian wetland in the Coastal Plain of Georgia, USA, for an abundant and diverse group of soil fauna

## Spatial distribution and temporal variation of reference 
27.04.2011Analysis of spatial and temporal variations of reference evapotranspiration (ET o) is important in arid and semi-arid regions where water resources are limited. The main aim of this study was to analyse the spatial distribution and the annual, seasonal and monthly trends of the Penman–Monteith ET o for 21 stations in the arid and semi-arid regions of Iran.

The 1995 flood layer has evolved from exhibiting limited variability and normal grading (i:e., upward fining) to a layer that (1) shows significant spatial variability on scales from centimeters to 10's of meters, (2) is substantially coarser owing to additions of sediment from the inner shelf, (3) is inversely graded (i.e., coarsens upward
