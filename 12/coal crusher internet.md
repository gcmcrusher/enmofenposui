## The tooth design and force analysis of the toothed roller crusher for coal
Abstract: The crusher has become an integral part of the coal washing technique. The crusher has complex working conditions in the crushing process. So its safety and reliability are the focus of the study. This paper presents a new type of crusher tooth that's double key location and easy to dismantle, and analyses the force of the crusher at all points during crushing of the material.

Features Benefits. A Cone Crusher will deliver a 4:1 to 6:1 reduction ratio. As we set the closed side setting tighter to create a finer output, we also reduce the volume or throughput capacity of the machine. Generally speaking, multiplying the closed side setting by two is a good guide to the top size of the gradation exiting the machine.

## Cone Crusher 
These crushers are designed so that the head-to-depth ratio is larger than the standard gyratory crusher and the cone angles are much flatter and the slope of the mantle and the concaves are parallel to each other. The flatter cone angles help to retain the particles longer between the crushing surfaces and therefore produce much finer particles.
