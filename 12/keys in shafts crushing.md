KEYS: A key is a piece of mild steel inserted between the shaft and hub or boss of the pulley to connect these together in order to prevent relative motion between them. It is always inserted parallel to the axis of the shaft. Keys are used as temporary fastenings and are subjected to considerable crushing and shearing stresses. A keyway is a slot or recess in a shaft and hub

## What is the eccentric throw? — SRP
The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesnrsquo;t stay in the center of the chamber ndash; it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action. At a given point on
