## Ball mill 
A ball mill, a type of grinder, is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores, chemicals, ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including ceramic balls, flint pebbles, and stainless steel balls.

Rod mills: Horizontal rods are used instead of balls to grind. Granularity of the discharge material is 40-10 mm. The mill speed varies from 12 to 30 rpm. Planetary mill: High energy mill widely used for producing metal, alloy, and composite powders. Fluid energy grinding or Jet milling: The basic principle of fluid energy mill is to induce

## Ball Milling The Role of Media and Bead Mills 
Basket bead milling is a relatively new design for ball milling applications. The grinding media is contained in a cylinder (basket), and the mill base is circulated through the basket. The VMA-Getzmann basket mill consists of a stainless-steel cylinder with an opening at the top and a sieve filter on the bottom. The standard diameter size of the grinding media is 1.0 mm. however, it

The NIR analysis method does not estimate the energy (TDN) content to wet (WDGS) or dry (DDGS) distillers grains plus solubles very well. Our data suggests that WDGS and DDGS are 125 percent the energy value of corn in forage diets. Therefore if corn is 90 percent TDN on a dry-matter basis then WDGS is 112.5 percent TDN (90% x 1.25)

18.06.2022A percentage is also a way to express the relation between two numbers as a fraction of 100.In other words, the percentage tells us how one number relates to another. If we know that number A is 25% of number B, we know that A to B is like 25 is to 100, or, after one more transformation, like 1 to 4, i.e.,A is four times smaller than B.This is what the percentage

Ball mills are widely used in mineral processing and chemical industries for particle size reduction. About one third of total electricity energy consumed by them was used to process powder, and almost half of this energy was wasted [1, 2].Their high energy consumption and low milling efficiency are still big challenges [3,4,5].The efficiency of the milling process is highly
