## Mill Critical Speed Calculation 
15.10.2015The mill was rotated at 63% of the critical speed. The position of the balls at the end of five revolutions is shown in Figure 2. It is seen that, using a low coefficient of friction at the walls, balls tend to flow down the surface of the charge, and a "toe" begins to form. As the friction at the wall increases, cataracting motion is observed.

## Microstructural Evolution, Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Powder 
During ball milling, a 5 min interval stopping was used after running 55 min to prevent excess generated heat that had an obvious effect on the ball-milling procedure. In order to avoid contamination, the powder mixtures were firstly milled at low speed for a few minutes, so a powder coating covered the stainless steel balls and vial wall.

Bond models, SGI, Morrell Mi. The Bond ball mill work index is one of the most commonly used grindability tests in mining, and is often referred to as the Bond work index . The test is a 'locked-cycle' test where ground product is removed from test cycles and replaced by fresh feed. The test much achieve a steady-state before completion.

Herein, we report an efficient method to produce graphene/polyaniline composites via a one-pot ball-milling process, in which aniline molecules act as both the intercalator for the exfoliation of graphite and the monomer for mechanochemical polymerization into polyaniline clusters on the in situ exfoliated graphene sheets.
