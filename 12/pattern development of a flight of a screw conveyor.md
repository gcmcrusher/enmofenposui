Compressing Flight. Compressing flight centres provide a continuous decrease in swept volume of the screw. This compresses and compacts the material as it is conveyed. The flights are typically canted forward to counter the forces of the compacting process. These are used in compacting, dewatering and decanting situations.

One ellipse is the width of the thickness of the root diameter of the screw with a length that fits the root diameter at the pitch you want to gain per cycle. The other width diameter is the inside diameter of the tube the screw runs in less some clearance. You cut one end of the flat out at the longest axis. You then stretch the pattern to fit

A screw conveyor is a very versatile and reliable means of horizontally conveying most bulk materials. INCLINED AND VERTICAL CONVEYINGcan be accomplished with a screw conveyor, however screws lose efficiency rapidly as the incline increases to 45. Short pitch flights and tubular housings are used to improve efficiency.
