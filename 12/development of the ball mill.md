## Sustainability 
11.08.2022When the ball milling time is increased to 45 min, the coarse BA is further crushed and refined, and the d 50 decreases from 26.3 μm to 13.2 μm. It is close to fly ash particle size, but it is still larger than the latter. Further increasing the ball milling time, the proportion of fine particles will continue to increase. However, at the

Abstract In recent years the applicability of high-speed stirred ball mills has been extended to process coarser feedstock and to produce finer product particle size. This development has been made possible by design- and process-related innovations, like the invention of new agitating and media separating systems and a device for continuous grinding processes that avoids

We analyzed the milling mechanism of a typical Ball End-Mill used for die-sinking and performed cutting tests. As a result, we have achieved high speed and fine quality die-sinking technology. Its feed speed is about four or five times as fast as before, and the irregularity of the milled surface is under one-fifth as compared with previous level.

ambient temperature.7 Therefore, ball-milling-induced reactions are, in general, cost effective, efficient and 'greener'. Several methods have been reported so far for the synthesis of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond formation under ball milling via cross-coupling reactions such as Suzuki, Sonogashira, Glaser and others.8,9

## Development of fem model for high speed machining using small ball 
The heat capacity of the small size of the ball 'end mill is considerably low, thus the end mill could suffer excessive increases of cutting temperature. The large ratio of feed rate per tool radius (0.1) could lead to increases of tool wear rate, thus worsen the heat capacity of small ball end mill. The study on effect of tool wear evolution
