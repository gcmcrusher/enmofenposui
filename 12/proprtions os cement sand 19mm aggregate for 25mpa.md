These grade of concrete is converted into various mix proportions. For example, for M20 concrete, mix proportion will be 1:1.5:3 for cement:sand:coarse aggregates.

Key points. ‚Ä¢ 'Aggregate' is a term for any particulate material. It includes gravel, crushed stone, sand, slag, recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregate may be natural, manufactured or recycled. ‚Ä¢ Aggregates make up some 60 -80% of the concrete mix. They provide compressive strength and bulk to concrete.
