## The cement mill 
Cement manufacturing -brief description of a cement mill. Cement clinker is usually ground using a ball mill. This is essentially a large rotating drum containing grinding media - normally steel balls. As the drum rotates, the motion of the balls crushes the clinker. The drum rotates approximately once every couple of seconds.

The cement mill's dynamic model is subjected to approximate linearization around a temporary operating point which is recomputed at each iteration of the control algorithm. This operating point is defined by the present value of the system's state vector and by the last value of the control inputs vector that was applied on the cement's mill model.

A 10 MW cement mill, output 270 tonnes per hour. A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage [1]) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.
