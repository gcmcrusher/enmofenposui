## Optimizing your SAG mill operation 
In the past, when primary, secondary and tertiary crushers fed material directly to large ball mills, the energy efficiency of the concentrator was determined for the most part by the ball mill operation, whereas now the energy efficiency of a plant often rests largely on the SAG mill operation. As a result, mines have shifted their emphasis in

SAG mills with a rated power of up to 35 MW. As well as ever larger SAG mills, ball mills are also expanding in size. In the late 1990s the trend moved towards using GMDs to power these larger ball mills, as well as using the drive to vary the speed. GMDs quickly moved from 20' ball mills, expanding to 24, 25 and then 26' mills
