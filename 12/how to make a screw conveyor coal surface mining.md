## How Coal Works 
Longwall mining involves cutting long tunnels into a coal seam and removing the extracted coal by conveyor belt. As the miners and the machinery move along the seam, Output per miner-hour rises as smaller coal mines close [8] Kennedy, Bruce. Surface Mining. SME 1990, pg. 68 [9] Energy Information Administration. January 26, 2015.

5 hours ago Screw conveyors make up one of many high-end material-handling options available from Continental Conveyor Ltd. These conveyor systems are important in major industries like construction, food processing, mining, and pulp and paper. But many people in these sectors tend to confuse these systems with screw feeders.

## Basic Information about Surface Coal Mining in Appalachia
Surface coal mining involves: removing parts or all of mountaintops to expose buried seams of coal, and. disposing in adjacent valleys the excess: overburden (rock above the coal seam), and. interburden (rock between coal seams). Overburden and interburden are disposed of in adjacent valleys because the broken rock will not all fit back

Mining methods differ depending on how far the coal is located below the Earth's surface. Underground At our Broadmeadow mine in Central Queensland, coal is mined by a longwall shearer deep underground. The coal is then transported to the surface on a conveyor belt and stockpiled. Impurities are removed through washing and treatment at a coal
