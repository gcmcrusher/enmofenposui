Jun 12, 2022Developing countries will increase their water usage by 50% by year 2025. It is estimated that this will result in 1.8 billion people living in a state of water scarcity. Meat (beef, pork, chicken) and chocolate processing require the most amount of water, with respective water footprints of 25,728 Liters/kg and 17,196 Liters/kg.

Jul 15, 2022Therefore, in the flotation process of barite ore, both inhibitors and collectors play a very important role. Under conventional flotation conditions, the recovery rate of barite can reach more than 80%, and the collector used also has good foaming properties, so the activator and foaming agent are rarely involved in barite flotation.

## Barite – Eshal Industries
Barite is used as a weighing agent in oil well-drilling fluids to counteract certain pressures that result from well drilling operations. In this process, Barite is crushed and mixed with water other materials. It is then pumped into the drill hole. The weight of this mixture counteracts the force of the oil and gas when it is released from the ground. This allows the oil and gas rig operators
