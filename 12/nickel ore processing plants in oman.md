Capacity. 30,000 T/Y. The Taganito Project involved JGC constructing an HPAL smelting plant for processing low-grade nickel ore into nickel metal. The plant is located in the Taganito region on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. This plant includes two massive 1,000-ton autoclaves (reactors) for leaching the low-grade nickel ore.

## Nickel Ore 
The same is true for a minerals processing plant – it will have to treat 1.25% Ni ore twice as fast as 2.5% Ni ore to achieve the same annual production of nickel-in-concentrate. This will require about twice the amount of concentrator equipment and about double the investment.
