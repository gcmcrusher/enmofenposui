## how to process nickel ore
Jan 15, 2019 Nickel smelting is the process that nickel ore goes through to eventually remove impurities and leave just the nickel metal. While the ores can come from different stones and sources, they have two categories: lateritic, or rocks found in tropical climates and which contain nickel; and sulfidic ore, which is mined from underground.

## copper processing 
copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

## Gold extraction 
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution, mineral processing, hydrometallurgical, and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.. Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing, resulting
