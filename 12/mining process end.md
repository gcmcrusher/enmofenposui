## What are task and process mining in AI? 
27.10.2021Unlike task mining, process mining focuses on processes. Process mining turns event logs from various IT systems into an instant visual model of a given flow. It depicts the as-is process based on facts with all its cases, variants, and paths. Process mining revolves around discovering, modeling, analyzing, monitoring, and optimizing end-to-end

Process mining provides a data-based description of processes and their performance and thus objectively and effortlessly maps real as-is processes. The data basis for process mining is an event log. Nevertheless, the generation of an event log in end-to-end order processing is not as trivial as in partial processes, as different data from different information systems must be

## The Mining Process 
The Mining Process. 1. Mining – Open Pit and Underground — To define the ore from the waste rock, samples are taken and assayed. Assay results are used to mark out areas of ore and waste rock, which are mined separately. Some of the harder areas require blasting to loosen the rock prior to excavation by hydraulic diggers.
