## Experimental Investigations and Field Applications of Chemical 
23/12/2018It is known that high dust concentrations are severely hazardous to health of miners and the safe operations of coal mines. The results of the suppressions of coal dust via chemical dust suppressant methods have been of critical significance, and these methods have been widely applied in coal mines. In this research study, a type of complex dust suppressant
