## Iron Ore 
Filtration plays a vital role in the dewatering of iron ore concentrate and, in many cases, tailings, in the control of process and ore transportation dust. With decades of knowledge on the extraction of iron ore from hematite and magnetite, we have engineered beneficiation and waste treatment filter media and hardware spares that perform to the highest standards.

## Iron Ore 
The iron formation-hosted iron ores are subdivided into unenriched iron formation ores, martite-goethite supergene ores, residual hematite ores and microplaty hematite ores. The three most common iron ore minerals are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ), hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ) and goethite (FeOOH), with the most common forms of goethite being brown, yellow ochreous, and dark
