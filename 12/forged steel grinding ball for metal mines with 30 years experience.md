Blade Steel Myth #2. As noted previously – hardness does not imply toughness. A hard blade designed for edge retention like a CTS-204P Southard by Spyderco will not be tough in terms of tensile strength. The same thing can be said about a 1075 chopper like the Condor Hudson Bay; it's tough but definitely not hard.

## Stainless steel 
Stainless steel is an alloy of iron that is resistant to rusting and corrosion.It contains at least 11% chromium and may contain elements such as carbon, other nonmetals and metals to obtain other desired properties. Stainless steel's resistance to corrosion results from the chromium, which forms a passive film that can protect the material and self-heal in the presence of oxygen.
