## Frontiers 
Robotic manipulators are widely used for precise operation in the medical field. Vibration suppression control of robotic manipulators has become a key issue affecting work stability and safety. In this paper an optimal trajectory planning control method to suppress the vibration of a variable-stiffness flexible manipulator considering the rigid-flexible coupling is proposed.

reducing car vibrations, but such suspension systems have not been employed for trains in service to reduce vibration in the vertical direction. However, RTRI has developed a secondary suspension vibration control system using vertical vertical hydraulic dampers and actually applied it to sightsee-ing limited express trains on narrow-gauge lines.

## Damping Techniques for Noise and Vibration Control
March 23, 2016 by Polymer Technologies Inc. Damping is one of the most effective methods of controlling noise and vibration. It is a process that converts vibrational energy into heat, eliminating the vibrational energy through friction and other processes. Increasing damping or stiffness can both reduce resonant vibration and the resulting
