This impact crusher achieves a high degree of reduction in size; for very fine end product sizes, however, we recommend installing a grinding track. Setting the gap is assisted hydraulically and thus easily adjustable. Depending on feed material and gap width, crushing capacity ranges of 110 t/h - 720 t/h are possible.
