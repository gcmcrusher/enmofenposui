## The milling process 
The flour milling process has evolved from wheat being ground between two large stone wheels (although this process does still occur in a few mills). In a roller mill the practice centres around separating the three components of a wheat seed – the white endosperm, the outer bran layers and the wheat germ. These are each made up of different materials and when separated and

## Ball Milling 
Ball milling is a mechanical technique that is broadly used to grind powders into fine particles [134–141]. The reactants are generally broken apart using solvent molecules in the traditional method; but in ball milling, reactants are broken by using mechanical forces. The term mechanochemistry has been introduced very recently [142].

## Roll Mill 
4.2.3.1.1 Roll Mills. The roll mill is the simplest batch mixing equipment. The principal design consists of two horizontal rolls, usually of equal size, arranged side by side and rotating toward each other at different speeds. The ratio of the peripheral speeds of the rolls, known as friction ratio, ranges from 1 to 2 but is usually around 1.2.
