## The basics of activated carbon adsorption 
01.02.2016Activated carbon is an inert solid adsorbent material commonly used to remove diverse, dissolved contaminants from water and process gas-phase streams. It is made from almost any feedstock that contains carbon, including coconut shells and coal family members, as many readers will already know. Adsorption is the accumulation of a gas or liquid

## How to Refine Gold (with Pictures) 
03.09.2020If your gold is unrefined, your best option may be to ship it to a refiner. These processes may be challenging and cost-prohibitive for you. Another issue is that if you try to refine your own scrap, you may only recover the gold and not the other precious metals that may be present, such as silver and platinum. One great refiner that has been

Processes have been developed to recover silver and gold when the value of these elements in the leach residue warrants it. At the Balen plant of Vieille Montagne in Belgium, the hot-acid leach residues were being floated to selectively recover first a silver–gold concentrate using a standard sulfide promoter, followed by lead sulfate
