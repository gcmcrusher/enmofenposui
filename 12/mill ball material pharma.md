PROCEDURE. Kept 100 gm of rice and charge it to series of sieves to get pregrinding size distribution. Continuous sieving for 10 minutes. Weigh the mass of rice retained on each sieve. Load the rice into ball mill along with metal balls. Run the ball mill for 30 minutes at a speed of 1 rpm. After 30 minutes take out rice powder from the ball mill.
