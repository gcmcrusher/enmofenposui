26.05.2016A considerable time frame would have to be given to the upstream sector to ensure adequate exploration and quantification of mineral reserves. Mineral beneficiation and value addition through absolute measuration will fast-track the development of the up and downstream operations and also revive the ailing industry.

02.02.2020The minister's sentiments are in sync with President Mnangagwa's push for local mineral beneficiation and value addition so as to boost earnings and create more jobs. One of the country's three existing PGM mines —Unki Mine — last year launched a US$62 million smelter which has a 61 000 tonnes annual capacity and can meet the miner's current output.

## Beneficiation and mineral processing of bauxite and feldspar
Beneficiation and mineral processing of bauxite and feldspar. Bauxite is a sedimentary rock that is rich in alumina, the base for making aluminum. It is generally easy to mine because it is found near the surface of terrain. However, the process for separating the alumina from the other base elements in bauxite can be environmentally unfriendly.

## Is local beneficiation essential? 
Generally, beneficiation is regarded as the transformation of a mineral (or a combination of minerals) to a higher value product, which can either be consumed locally or exported. Each of the four stages may, therefore, provide an opportunity to beneficiate to greater value, for domestic or export use. It is perhaps appropriate for the key stakeholders in the mining industry to take

What is Talc. The term talc refers both to the pure mineral and a wide variety of soft, talc-containing rocks that are mined and utilized for a variety of applications. Talc forms mica-like flakes. Talc is the softest mineral on the Mohs hardness scale at 1 and can be easily cut and crushed. Talc has perfect cleavage in one direction.
