## Gypsum 
Gypsum is the name given to a mineral categorized as calcium sulfate mineral, and its chemical formula is calcium sulfate dihydrate, CaSO 4 ⋅ 2H 2 O. However, a broader definition includes all the calcium sulfates, including calcium sulfate hemihydrate, CaSO 4 ⋅ 0.5H 2 O, which is known as plaster or plaster of Paris (POP). Figure 6 summarizes the polymorphism of calcium sulfate;
