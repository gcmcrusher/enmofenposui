28.03.2021The coal is unloaded from the point of delivery by means of wagon tippler. It is rack and pinion type. The coal is taken from the unloading site to dead storage by belt conveyors. The belt deliver the coal to 0m level to the pent house and further moves to transfer point 8. The transfer points are used to transfer coal to the next belt.

 The gauges were mounted about 10 m downstream of a conveyor transfer point where the coal is well mixed. The two gauge frames were mounted about 0.5 m apart on rollers. This allowed the gauges to scan across the belt and to be moved beyond its edge for calibration. A plough and leveller system was installed about 2 m upstream of the gauges.
