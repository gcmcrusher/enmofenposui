## What Is Rebar 
It the extensively and majorly used for reinforcement functions in a construction. These bars are created in sections or sizes from 4 mm to 50 millimeters in diameter. Different Types of Rebar And Does it Matter? The compressive strength of concrete is very high (Tremendous). Incredible force is required to crush concrete.

## Why Smartcrushers 
Also see the TU/e report (page 20) and Cement 2013 (page 5) When compared with traditional crushers, SmartCrusher uses about 85% less energy for each processed tonne of concrete rubble. With the SmartCrusher it is possible to recycle 100% of steel-fibre concrete. Steel fibre is the concrete reinforcement of the present and of the future.

## Geogrid reinforced soil structures reach new heights
01.06.2019Geogrids for soil reinforcement were developed around 1980. The first use of a geogrid in soil reinforcement was in 1981, and extensive use of geogrid products in the United States began in about 1983. Since the early 1980s, the use of geosynthetics in reinforced soil structures has increased significantly, and they now comprise a growing
