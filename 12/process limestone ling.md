## how to process limestones 
 So, in simple terms, if the process were carried out with 1 tonne of limestone which was pure calcium carbonate, it should produce 560 kg of quicklime. And if 180 kg (approximately 180 litres) of water were added to this quicklime, then 740 kg of calcium hydroxide should result. Some limestones are
