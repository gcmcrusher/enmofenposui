## 5 CNC Machining Trends for 2021 
These five trends are on the horizon — and almost certain to shape the direction of CNC machining in 2021. 1. More axes for greater cost-savings. Traditional CNC machines feature linear motion in three axes. While many machines now include a moving bed, a 3-axis milling center remains still as the cutter itself moves.
