## Ball mill 
Ball mill. A ball mill, a type of crusher, is a cylindrical device used to grind chemicals or mix compositions. Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium, ideally non sparking milling media like lead balls. An internal cascading effect reduces the material to a fine powder.

## The working principle of ball mill 
22/05/201922 May, 2019. The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force. At a certain height, it will automatically
