The quality of cement clinker is directly related to the chemistry of the raw materials used. Around 80–90% of raw material for the kiln feed is limestone. Clayey raw material accounts for between 10–15%, although the precise amounts will vary. Magnesium carbonate, which may be present in limestone, is the main undesirable impurity. The level

A cement is a binder, a substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel, produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is

The proportioning of cement raw materials is not all the same but should be determined according to the actual situation. The proportion of raw materials of different specifications of cement is also different. Generally, the proportion of components in cement raw materials is 67-75% limestone, 10-15% clay, 0.5-1.5% iron ore and 8.5-11% coal.

. Lime forms nearly two-third (2/3) of the cement. Therefore sufficient quantity of the lime must be in the raw materials for the manufacturing of cement. 2. Its proportion has an important effect on the cement. Sufficient quantity of lime forms di- calcium silicate and tri-calcium silicate in the manufacturing of cement. 3.
