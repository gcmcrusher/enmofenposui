## Estimation of maximum crushing capacity of hammer mills
01.01.1992An empirical equation to estimate the maximum crushing capacity of hammer mills was obtained. The maximum crushing capacity measured was on an average about 1.5 times larger than the value calculated from the empirical equation. However, the approximate estimation of the maximum crushing capacity of hammer mills was possible. Previous article.
