## FOUNDRY SAND WASTE 
FOUNDRY SAND WASTE. Foundries create metal castings for use in the automotive, art, construction, agriculture, and mining industries. In this process, molten metal is poured into a mold, usually made from sand or ceramics. As castings are created, the sand has to be removed and replaced due to abrasion from the high heat and mechanical stress.
