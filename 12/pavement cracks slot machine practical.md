Crack Seals. Crack seal products are used to fill individual pavement cracks to prevent entry of water or other non-compressible substances such as sand, dirt, rocks or weeds. Crack sealant is typically used on early stage longitudinal cracks, transverse cracks, reflection cracks and block cracks. Fatigue cracks are most often too extensive to

## Laboratory observation of cracks in road pavements with GPR
Abstract. Cracks are one of the main distress mechanisms that affects the structural performance, comfort and durability of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) layers in road pavements. These cracks are generally of small size and can occur superficially, from top to bottom, from bottom to top, or they can run across the entire HMA layer thickness.
