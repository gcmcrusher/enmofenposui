## PREDICTION OF PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF A BALL MILL 
02.12.2021In the mining industry, it is important to minimize the wastage of raw materials while achieving the desired particle size distribution by grinding the original input mix. To date, the procedure is performed manually, and there is no such control mechanism for grinding that reduces wastage to achieve the desired output, resulting in the loss of material.

## EFFECT OF GRINDING MEDIA ON THE MILLING EFFICIENCY OF A BALL MILL
The size of grinding media is the primary factor that affects the overall milling efficiency of a ball mill (e.g. power consumption and particle size breakage). This article tackles the lack of a design tool that could help choose the ball loading composition in mills. Such a tool enables the maximization of the exposed surface area per unit energy (cm2/J).

15.09.2020Ball mill is a grinding machine used in mineral processing, comprising of a rotating cylindrical shell filled with steel balls and the material to be ground. The ball mill is inevitably accompanied by vibration during operation since the main cause of this vibration is the tumbling of steel ball and material to be ground. This vibration may lead to resonance and even to failure

The milling process is characterized by a fixed milling chamber and a spinning rotor (Figure 1). This rotor causes a very high acceleration of the milling balls. So, both the milling process and the cold-welding process can be used to produce composite powders. Using these permanent cold-welding, breaking and milling processes, a very homogeneous
