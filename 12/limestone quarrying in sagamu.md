## Environmental effect of mineral exploitation in Nigeria
mining operations in the Nigerian limestone quarries are discharged daily into the air. Similarly a lot of air-borne particulate matters are generated by the numerous stone-crushing industries in the country. When the air is laden with such dust, it causes health hazards for some people. For example, pollution studies around Sagamu and Ewe-

It is an extensive limestone body, which is traceable over a distance of about 320km continuously from Ghana eastward, towards the eastern margin of the Dahomey basin in Nigeria. The limestone is about 15m thick at the Ewekoro quarry while at Sagamu quarry, it is about 20m.
