## Test design techniques 
Test design techniques. Test design can be as simple as hitting some keys unprepared to see if a system works at all (called ad hoc testing). And it can be as sophisticated as identifying test situations, assuring coverage by designing test cases, automating these in a test script and executing the script to automatically create a test report.
