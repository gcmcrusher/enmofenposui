To describe the profile grinding process, the coordinate system is established, as shown in Fig. 21. O 1, g is the gear coordinate system. O 2 is the auxiliary coordinate system. O 3, w is the grinding wheel coordinate system. The rotational angle of the workpiece is φ, and the installation angle of the grinding wheel is γ.
