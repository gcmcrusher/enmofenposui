## pit limit in open pit mining 
Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow.. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.Open-pit mines are used when

## Surface Mining Equipment Market Report 
Surface mining denotes the removal of the terrain surface so as to access minerals underneath. Surface mining equipment are used in surface mining to remove the overburden (soil and rock) overlying a mineral deposit. In particular, the process of surface mining is used to retrieve sand, gravel, stones, coal, iron and other metals.
