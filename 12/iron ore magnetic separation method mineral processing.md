28.11.2021The magnetic ore stays on the belt, while the gangue slides off. By eliminating non-magnetic impurities, this process is utilised to concentrate magnetic ores of iron such as magnetite and chromite and manganese (pyrolusite). A magnetic separator is used in this procedure. A magnetic separator is made out of two rollers and a leather belt.

## Magnetic separation 
Magnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using a magnet to attract magnetic substances. The process that is used for magnetic separation separates non-magnetic substances from those which are magnetic. This technique is useful for the select few minerals which are ferromagnetic (iron-, nickel-, and cobalt-containing minerals) and
