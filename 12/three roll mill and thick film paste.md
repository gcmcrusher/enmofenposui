27.10.2014Chocolate mass is a shear thinning fluid, so the highest viscosity is found when the mass starts to flow. Interaction between particles is considered to be responsible for this behaviour 3, which is very different to Newtonian fluids such as water. So one important part of the flow curve is at very low shear.
