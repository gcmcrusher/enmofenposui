11.08.2022Purpose Soil pollution is a major problem worldwide. Some anthropogenic activities, such as mining, may exceed soil capacity, causing relevant health and ecosystem hazards. The use of mineral amendments can help reduce soil pollution. Gypsum mining spoil (GS) is a waste material highly produced in gypsum mining industry, which has never been used in soil

## how the gypsum mining affect the earth 
The gypsum has a significant effect on the amount of soil erosion. The effectiveness is greater when the gypsum particles are spread over the soil rather than mixed in the top 10 cm of soil. The presence of gypsum on the soil surface increases soil stability by increasing EC in the percolated solution and by decreasing ESP. This effect of

## Gypsum 
Gypsum is a mineral found in crystal as well as masses called gypsum rock. It is a very soft mineral and it can form very pretty, and sometimes extremely large colored crystals. Massive gypsum rock forms within layers of sedimentary rock, typically found in thick beds or layers. It forms in lagoons where ocean waters high in calcium and sulfate content can slowly evaporate
