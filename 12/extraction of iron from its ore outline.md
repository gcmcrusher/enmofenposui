01.12.2015Research about extraction of iron from chemical‐grade South African chromite by carbothermic reduction and hydrochloric acid leaching was conducted in this study. It was found that temperature had a remarkable effect on the extraction yield of iron and that the optimum experimental temperature was 1100 C, which coincides with the theoretically predicted value.

Extraction of iron from Haematite - using Blast furnace Haematite is the main ore of iron and contains iron(III) oxide mixed with impurities such as clay and sand. A blast furnace is used to extract iron from haematite. Iron ore (haematite), coke (carbon) and limestone (calcium carbonate) are added from the top of the furnace.

## Review of conventional iron and steel production techniques
2.2.4 Agglomeration techniques of iron ore fines . Iron ore fines constitute a large portion of the iron ore produced around the world, but cannot be used directly in most of the conventional iron production techniques. This is because fine materials clog the voids and consequently reduce the 8 permeability of the slag and decrease the production rate of furnaces (Biswas, 1981). For the

## Application of the reactivity series of metals in the extraction 
01.12.2020In extracting metals, carbon in the form of coke is used. Carbon is widely used in the extraction of zinc, iron, tin and lead for a number of reasons: (a) First of all, carbon is more reactive than zinc, iron, tin and lead. Therefore, carbon can easily reduce the oxide of these metals. (b) Furthermore, carbon is cheap and easily available.
