The process depends very much of the gold alloy composition. I live in Europe and the gold here tipically is made with more than 20% silver and you need to alloy it down, making it time and power consuming. You will not obtain tipically 99.95 gold purity from the first pass but a decent 22 k gold alloy. For 24 k you will need another pass.
