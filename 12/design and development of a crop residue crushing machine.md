In addition, there are savings in machinery investment and in the time required for seedbed preparation (Lal 1974, 1985b; Rockwood and Lal 1974). Antap and Angen (1990) report that retaining crop residues on the soil surface with conservation tillage reduces evapotranspiration, increases infiltration rates, and suppresses weed growth.
