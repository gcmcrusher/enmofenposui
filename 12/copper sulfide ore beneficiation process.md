08.09.2021Separation flotation method can also achieve good results for refractory oxidized copper ore. It is to crush the mineral to a certain particle size, mix 0.1% ~ 1.0% salt and 0.5% ~ 2.0% pulverized coal, and heat it to about 900 ℃ in oxygen isolation. The copper in the ore will precipitate on the carbon particle surface in metal state.
