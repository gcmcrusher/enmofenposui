 At 2/3 rd speed at which centrifugation just occurs is called the critical speed of the ball mill. At this speed the balls are carried almost to the top of the mill and then fall in a cascade across the diameter of the mill. By this means the maximum size reduction is obtained by impact of the particles between the balls and by attrition
