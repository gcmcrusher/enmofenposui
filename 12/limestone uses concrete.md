## Portland
The same clinker is used to make portland cement and portland-limestone cement, but there is less of it in PLC. And concrete mixes designed with PLCs are compatible with all supplementary cementing materials (SCMs), so when you substitute PLC for ordinary portland cement, you can continue to use all the other materials you use to make concrete for an even greater

## THE USE OF LIMESTONE AGGREGATE IN CONCRETE
Concrete structure is made up of cement, aggregate and water. In building construction the aggregates commonly used are limestone and granite. Three quarters of concrete is made up from aggregate, thus the selection of aggregate should be in the prime condition. To produce a good, strength and high quality

## Portland cement 
Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and non-specialty grout.It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the early 19th century by Joseph Aspdin, and is usually made from limestone.It is a fine powder, produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln to

Available in a standard measure of 60 x 20 cm and a thickness of 2.5-4 cm, these panels can be used in interior and exterior cladding thanks to its incorporated mechanical anchor for installation on surfaces higher than two meters. Limestone is a highly valued stone by architects for traditional and contemporary projects.

## Limestone filler : GCCA
The first significant use of limestone in Portland cement took place during World War Two, when it was used by several European countries to reduce the cost and increase the quantity of production. Its widespread use today can be traced back to the 1973 oil crisis and to France, which had low production of other SCMs, such as fly ash and granulated blastfurnace slag.

## The Suitability Of Limestone Aggregates For Use In Structural Concrete
Limestone Aggregate in Asphaltic Concrete. Limestone aggregate is also generally suitable for use in Asphaltic Concrete and is economically feasible when the absorption is relatively low (Less than 2.5%). High absorption rates may result in added asphalt binder needed to allow for asphalt absorbed by the aggregate.

22.06.2020Moreover,. Crushed limestone aggregates proved nearly 10% of high in strength compared to traditional gravels used in cement-concrete mixer. The strength comes from the angular shapes and sharp edges of crushed limestone aggregates compared to rounded-shaped gravels obtained from natural resources, which formed through weathering processes.

Flux Stone: Crushed limestone is used in smelting and other metal refining processes. In the heat of smelting, limestone combines with impurities and can be removed from the process as slag. Portland Cement: Limestone is heated in a kiln with shale, sand, and other materials and ground to a powder that will harden after being mixed with water.
