Typical reduction ratios are: Primary crusher: 3:1 to 10:1; Secondary crusher: 6:1 to 8:1; Tertiary crusher: 10:1 Therefore, if a 3 mm crusher product is required, maximum feed size to the secondary

## Cone Crusher VS Gyratory Crusher 
The cone crusher has 2.5 times higher rotating speed and 4 times larger swinging angle than the gyratory crusher, so the ore is impacted quickly. Therefore, it is advantageous to the ore crushing, the crushing efficiency is high. 2. Different applications. In large quarries, gyratory crushers are often used as primary crushers.
