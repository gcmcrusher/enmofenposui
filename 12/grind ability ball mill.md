## Ball Mill Explained 
If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills. Ball mills may be primary or secondary grinders.

HGI for coal is determined by grinding 50 g of sample in a ball and ring type mill for 60 revolutions, after which the product is sieved through a 200 mesh sieve (75 micron screen) (Speight, 1994). HGI is computed by measuring the undersize of the product. Coals with higher HGI are easy to grind (Speight, 1994).
