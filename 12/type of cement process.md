## History of Cement 
The History of Portland Cement. Cement as we know it was first developed by Joseph Aspdin, an enterprising 19th-century British stonemason, who heated a mix of ground limestone and clay in his kitchen stove, then pulverized the concoction into a fine powder. The result was the world's first hydraulic cement: one that hardens when water is added.

This is obtained from the quarry where, after the removal of overburden, the rock is blasted, loaded into trucks and transported to the crusher. A multistage crushing process reduces the rock to stone less than 25 mm in diameter.

04.10.2013As little as 0.001% of sugar, if mixed with cement, renders it worthless. Some cement companies do not allow cement to be carried on vessels which have carried previous sugar cargoes. Temperature: It is important to check the temperature of cement before loading, as its temperature can be as high as 110C when leaving the production site.
