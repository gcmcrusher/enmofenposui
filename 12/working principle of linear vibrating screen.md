## Different Types of Vibrating Screens and Their Working Principle
21.03.2020Linear Vibrating Screen. This is the type of screen that is driven by dual vibrating motors and when the motors rotate synchronously and reversely and excitation force is created by eccentric block offsets in the direction parallel to an axis of the motor. This overlaps into resultants force in the direction perpendicular to the axis of a motor
