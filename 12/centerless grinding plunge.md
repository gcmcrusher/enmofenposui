## Simulation of plunge centerless grinding processes 
21/11/2007Workpiece out-of-roundness is one of the most important problems in centerless grinding. Besides geometrical and kinematical effects, the dynamical behavior of the machine structure, the grinding and regulating wheel together with the support blade fundamentally influence the process stability and the workpiece accuracy. The paper presents a method for a
