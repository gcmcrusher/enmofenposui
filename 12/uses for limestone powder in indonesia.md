## Calcium oxide 
Preparation. Calcium oxide is usually made by the thermal decomposition of materials, such as limestone or seashells, that contain calcium carbonate (CaCO 3; mineral calcite) in a lime kiln.This is accomplished by heating the material to above 825 C (1,517 F), a process called calcination or lime-burning, to liberate a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO 2), leaving quicklime.
