## Drying — Vikaspedia
Natural Drying. The natural drying method consists essentially of exposing the threshed products to the air (in sun or shade). To obtain the desired moisture content, the grain is spread in thin layers on a drying-floor, where it is exposed to the air. The duration may vary depending upon the moisture content required for safe storage.

14.08.2018At the final stage, cement is packaged into bags and ready to produce concrete. The first step in the process of making concrete is mixing cement, water, sand and gravel in the proportion of 15%, 10%, 25% and 50% respectively. This mixture is then put into a concrete mixer to produce concrete, which is used for building purposes.

## Cement 
A cement is a binder, a substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel, produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is

accomplished by any of three processes: the dry process, the wet process, or the semidry process [10]. In a dry cement manufacturing process, dry raw mix contains less than 20% moisture by mass. However, in a wet process water is added to the raw mix to form slurry and then is transported to the kiln [11].
