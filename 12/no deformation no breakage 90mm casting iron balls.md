Pig iron when re-melted and refined becomes cast iron. It contains 3-4.5 % carbon and other alloying elements particularly silicon, sulphur, manganese and phosphorous. Wrought iron is highly refined iron with less than one percent of carbon and a small amount of slag that gives the metal a peculiar fibrous structure. Carbon steel contains carbon up to 1.5 % distributed

## Cast iron 
Cast iron is a class of iron–carbon alloys with a carbon content more than 2%. Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature. The alloy constituents affect its color when fractured: white cast iron has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through, grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks
