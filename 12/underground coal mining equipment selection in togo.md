Highwall mining is an adaptation of auger mining. Instead of an auger hole, an entry into the coal seam is made by a continuous miner, remotely operated from a cabin at the surface. The cut coal is transported by conveyors behind the miner to the outside. Using a television camera, the operator can see and control the miner's progress.

25.02.2021The absolute three-dimensional position of a longwall shearer is fundamental to longwall mining automation. The positioning of the longwall shearer is usually realized by the inertial navigation system (INS) and odometer (OD). However, the position accuracy of this positioning approach gradually decreases over time due to the gyro drift. To further increase
