## Understanding Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) in Power 
15/03/2017Total harmonic distortion (THD) is an important aspect in power systems and it should be kept as low as possible. Lower THD in power systems means higher power factor, lower peak currents, and higher efficiency. Low THD is such an important feature in power systems that international standards such as IEC set limits on the harmonic

## What are power factor correction capacitors? 
12/08/2020Fixed power factor correction capacitors are typically installed for individual motors or banks of motors. These capacitors are on when the motor is on (and off when the motor is off), which avoids having capacitance on the system when the motor is not requiring reactive power. Automatically switched capacitors are used in centralized capacitor
