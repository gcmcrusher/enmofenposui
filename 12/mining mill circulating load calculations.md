## SINGLE STAGE SAG/AG MILLING DESIGN 
the S/AG mill will result in high circulating loads which can result in slurry pool formation due to grate and pulp lifter restrictions, further adversely affecting circuit performance. Achieving fine grind sizes in single stage mills has typically required operation of an AG mill to provide adequate grinding media surface area and a consistent and competent feed. Consideration of
