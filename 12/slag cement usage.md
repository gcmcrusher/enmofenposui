Key Takeaway. Portland slag cement. Definition: It is a blended Portland cement in which a suitable proportion of Portland cement clinker, gypsum and granulated blast furnace slag are mixed and ground into a thorough mixture. The quantity of granulated slag used in the production of Portland slag cement is 25% to 65% to the Portland cement clinker.

## Magnesium slag Usage 
In addition, magnesium slag can also be used as road building materials. When magnesium slag is mixed with 5% lime or 2% cement stabilized soil, it can be used as the base layer of high-grade or second-grade pavement. After the magnesium slag is ground by a ball mill or other processes, its use effect will be better.

## Slag 
Slag. Ground-granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) is produced by quenching molten iron slag (a by-product of iron and steel-making) from a blast furnace in water, to produce a granular product that is then dried and ground into a fine powder. When added to concrete, GGBFS enhances a range of performance characteristics such as the reduction of

## Steel
The cement uses only 15-30% of OPC clinker, 30-40% of steel-slag and 40-50% of blastfurnace slag (BFS), allowing for great reductions in GHG emissions, consumption of virgin natural resources and energy use by between 70% and 85%. The characteristics of steel-slag as a supplementary cementitious material are also discussed.

## Introduction of slag cement – Cement Science
By Cement. May 27, 2012. No Comments. Blast-furnace slag (BFS) is formed from a liquid at C during the manufacture of iron. When reaching the bottom of the furnace, the liquid slag forms a layer on top of the molten iron due to its lower density. Being separated from the molten iron, the liquid slag is cooled in the air or with water.

Environmental and LEEDS Benefits. In addition to it's high strength and durability, slag cement is an environmentally "green" product. In providing a beneficial use of an industrial by-product, it reduces the energy required to produce concrete while at the same time improving the quality of the concrete for a more durable, longer lasting product.

## What is slag cement or ground granulated blast
Slag cement or GGBFS is granulated blast-furnace slag that has been finely ground and that is hydraulic cement. When slag cement is mixed with water, however, the initial hydration is much slower than portland cement mixed with water; therefore, portland cement or salts of alkali metals, principally sodium and potassium or lime, are used to increase the reaction rate of
