## Development of new fire‐proof products made from coal fly ash
18/02/2002Fly ash (FA) is a by‐product of coal combustion in power plants whose characteristics depend on the type of combustion process and coal properties. A large proportion of FA is used by the cement and concrete industries, but most is disposed to landfill, potentially causing environmental problems.
