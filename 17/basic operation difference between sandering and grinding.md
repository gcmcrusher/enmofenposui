## Machining Processes: Turning, Milling, and Drilling – Trimantec
We cover three of the most common operations including turning, drilling, and milling. Machining is a very common and versatile manufacturing process. Thus, it's possible to machine various types of material using these three methods. Metals, plastics, composites, and wood are all possible workpiece materials.

## Basic Tips on Profile Grinding 
Nov 26, 2008From Dr. David Rankin, forum technical advisor: Profile grinding is not difficult as long as some basics are understood: 1) Use the correct grinding wheel for the steel that you are grinding. 2) Use a proper coolant that will keep the tool cool and not be dangerous to the operator. 3) Use a proper motion.

## Gear Lapping Grinding 
The two basic methods for gear grinding are form grinding (non-generating) and generation grinding. Form grinders use a disc wheel to grind both sides of the space between two gear teeth, and have an involute form dressed into the side of the wheel; a generating grinding wheel, on the other hand, is straight-sided.

## Guide to Cutting Wheels 
With a basic cut-off operation, precision is not critical, but with complex work or repairs that need to preserve the initial aesthetic qualities of the material, precision can save time and money. Using a 0.045-inch cutting wheel — a little more than a millimeter thick — is common in welding to allow for precise and accurate cuts.
