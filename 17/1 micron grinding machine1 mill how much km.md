The Operating Principal. P ulverization takes place in the central chamber of the Micron-Master jet energy mill as the process material is driven at near sonic velocity around the perimeter of the toroidal chamber by multiple jets of air or steam. No grinding media is involved. Size reduction is the result of the high-velocity collisions between particles of the process material itself.

As the abrasive oscillates, the workpiece rotates or oscillates under a cup or cylinder, producing microfine chips. The process removes as little as 0.5 micron (0.00002 inch) or as much as 20 microns (0.008 inch) of material.
