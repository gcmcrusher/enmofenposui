Generally, rutile and ilmenite ores are treated sepa-rately. The principal method in titanium ores treatment is to produce a concentrate of mineral via convention-al mineral beneficiation techniques [1, 15]. The ore is first crushed and ground. Then, magnetic separation is used for iron (magnetite) removal. For separation of

09.12.2019Titanium is a material that is obtained by refining ilmenite in the Ore Refining System. Specifically, ilmenite ore can be mined using the Mine Extractor in 13-14 minutes and then refined in 6.66. Alternatively, an ilmenite earring can be recycled; this will yield an ilmenite gem, which can then be refined to gain titanium in 1-2

The ilmenite deposits are located in an irregular sheet-like body of essentially massive hemo-ilmenite. Ore occurs in pure anorthosite with local hypersthene-rich zones overlain by coarsely banded hemo-ilmenite and anorthosite (Hammond, 1952). The hemo-ilmen-ite ore contains 2–3% MgO and about 1% MnO, with

Ilmenite is one of the most significant ore s of the metal titanium. It is mined as an important industrial mineral in several deposits throughout the world. Many of those deposits are in heavy placer sands. Ilmenite is very similar in structure to Hematite, and is essentially the same as Hematite with roughly half the iron replaced with titanium.
