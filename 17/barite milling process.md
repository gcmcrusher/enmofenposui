## Effect of mechanical activation on the barite 
25.01.2012The milling energy employed was not enough to produce the reactions between barite and coke during the milling process. −. The mechanical activation process improves the kinetics of barite carbothermic reduction. It was found that 3.6 ks of milling decreases the activation energy of barite reduction from 519 to 276 kJ/mol.

15.07.2022Therefore, in the flotation process of barite ore, both inhibitors and collectors play a very important role. Under conventional flotation conditions, the recovery rate of barite can reach more than 80%, and the collector used also has good foaming properties, so the activator and foaming agent are rarely involved in barite flotation.
