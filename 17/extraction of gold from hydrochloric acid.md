In the extraction of silver and gold from hydrochloric acid solution, a completely different extraction behavior was observed between these two types of the reagents. The extraction behavior was examined in detail for silver and was found to be dependent on whether silver ion was extracted as a cationic species or a anionic species complexed with chloride ion.

19.06.20221,074. Location. Netherlands, Zeeland. Jun 9, 2022. #2. Welcome to the forum. short answer: No. A deficiency of HCl can prevent a selective reagent from working. Any free nitric will not stop SMB from working, but will re-dissolve the pm's. An excess of HCl is no problem.
