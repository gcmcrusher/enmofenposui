## The Cement Manufacturing Process 
20.08.2015Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay, to a fine powder, called raw meal, which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 C in a cement kiln. In this process, the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are

There are four stages in the manufacture of portland cement: (1) crushing and grinding the raw materials, (2) blending the materials in the correct proportions, (3) burning the prepared mix in a kiln, and (4) grinding the burned product, known as " clinker," together with some 5 percent of gypsum (to control the time of set of the cement).
