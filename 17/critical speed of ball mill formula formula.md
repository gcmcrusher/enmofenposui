## The ball mill 
04/07/2022The corresponding critical rotational speed, Nc in revolutions per unit time, is given by: In this equation, r is the radius of the mill less that of the particle. It is found that the optimum speed is between one-half and three-quarters of the critical speed. Figure 2.28 illustrates conditions in a ball mill operating at the correct rate.

Dipak K. Sarkar, in Thermal Power Plant, 2015 4.6.1 Low-speed mill. Mills operating below 75 rpm are known as low-speed mills.Low-speed units include ball or tube or drum mills, which normally rotate at about 15–25 rpm.Other types of mills, e.g., ball-and-race and roll-and-race mills, that generally fall into the medium-speed category may also be included in this category
