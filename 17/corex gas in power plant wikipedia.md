## Combined Cycle Power Plant 
Combined-cycle power plants (Fig. 2.3) are compound gas turbine–steam turbine systems wherein the extreme hot exhaust from a gas turbine is employed to run a boiler, and the steam thus produced is fed into a steam turbine to generate power.These plants can deliver high power output at efficiencies as high as 50%–60% with low emissions and produce 50% more

## How Gas Turbine Power Plants Work 
How Gas Turbine Power Plants Work. The combustion (gas) turbines being installed in many of today's natural-gas-fueled power plants are complex machines, but they basically involve three main sections: The compressor, which draws air into the engine, pressurizes it, and feeds it to the combustion chamber at speeds of hundreds of miles per hour.

Types. There are two types of natural gas power plants: Simple cycle gas plants and combined cycle gas plants.The former consists of a gas turbine connected to a generator and the latter consists of a simple cycle plant, combined with another external combustion engine, operating on the Rankine cycle—hence its name combined cycle.. The simple cycle is simpler but less

Worldwide, up to 70 percent of steel is made via blast furnace–basic oxygen furnace (BF/BOF), which uses feed materials of up to 25 percent scrap. Most of the remaining 30 percent of global steel production is made via electric arc furnace.
