## Strip Mining 
2.3 Strip Mining. Strip mining is employed in coal reserves where the overburden is removed in rectangular blocks in plan view called pits or strips. The pits are parallel and adjacent to each other. Strip mining is fundamentally different from contour or area mining on how the overburden is displaced, called spoil handling.

Platinum (element #78, symbol Pt) is a dense, silvery-gray metal. The platinum group of elements consists of metals with similar physical properties as platinum and these elements are among the rarest in the Earth's crust. They have high melting points, are dense or heavy and are non-reactive with other elements.

## Extracting Gold 
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.
