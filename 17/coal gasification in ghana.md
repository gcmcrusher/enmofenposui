## Challenges and opportunities for coal gasification in developing 
The first is South Africa, which established the world's only commercial-scale coal-to-liquids and coal-to- chemicals facilities at Secunda and Sasolburg respectively. The other is China, where there is a major gasification-based coal conversion development and deployment programme that is set to become a significant, large-scale commercial element in the nation's energy

## IN SITU COAL GASIFICATION: AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY 1
The gasification process creates synthesis gas that can be used as fuel, or feedstock for further chemical processes such as NH3 production or liquid fuels. An oxidant (usually air, oxygen, or steam) is injected into the coal seam and reacts with the coal and water present in the seam to produce syngas that is extracted through a production well. As the gasification process

## Addressing Energy Poverty and the Case for Coal in Africa
With coal representing the 'dirtiest' fossil fuel, Africa needs to adopt clean coal power generation solutions such as coal gasification and coal-to-liquid to avoid increasing greenhouse gas emissions. South Africa, with its Majuba, Theunissen and Sterkfontein projects, and Botswana, with its Serowe and Letlhakeng clean coal projects, are leading the way in this regard.

Coal gasification is the production of coal gas (a mixture of mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide) from coal adding agents like steam/water and oxygen, which can be used in a number of industrial processes (e.g. hydroformulation and Fischer-Tropsch process). Many different kinds of coal do naturally occur, and due to shrinking natural resources, there has been a

The scoping report also mentions the possibility of a coal gasification plant. The EIS should elaborate on the arguments for dismissal of this high-effi-ciency option. The NCEA advises to compare the biomass co-firing possibilities and the different . characteristics of the emissions and residues from gasification and combustion in the EIS.
