## Heap Leaching of Copper Ores – State of the Science
Jan 01, 2019Heap leaching accounts for around 20% of the global production of copper. In heap leaching coarsely crushed ore particles are contacted with an aqueous lixiviant percolating through large packed beds (heaps) of the ore particles, with the loaded solution collected at the foot of the heap for metal recovery, solution make-up and recycle.
