## What Can Be Used To Dissolve Silicone Caulking? 
03:06. Use mineral spirits, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, or white vinegar to dissolve silicone caulking. Toulene and xylene are extremely potent but you should only use them as a last resort to dissolve silicone caulking. Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) is strong enough to dissolve silicone, but you may need to scrape away the remnants.

That means it also protects against liquid-borne chemicals that can deteriorate concrete or corrode steel reinforcing, even in harsh, aggressive environments. When a cement particle hydrates, the reaction between water and the cement causes it to become a hard, solid, rocklike mass. The reaction also generates chemical by-products that lie dormant in the concrete.
