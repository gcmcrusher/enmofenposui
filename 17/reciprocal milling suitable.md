Milling is the process of machining flat, curved, orMilling machines are basically classified as vertical or irregular surfaces by feeding the workpiece against a rotating horizontal. These machines are also classified as knee-type, Place a wooden pad or suitable cover over the table surface to protect it from possible damage.

## Milling Machine: Definition, Parts, Operation, Working Principle 
Milling Machine Definition: The milling machine is a type of machine which removes the material from the workpiece by feeding the work past a rotating multipoint cutter.The metal removal rate is higher very high as the cutter has a high speed and many cutting edges. It is the most important machine in the tool room as nearly all the operations can be performed on it with high accuracy.

## Difference Between Surface Roughness and Surface Finish
Jun 04, 2019Surface roughness refers to the height of macro and micro asperities and irregularities present on a finished surface after machining; while surface finish indicates quality of that surface using various attributes (like fine, rough, good, poor, etc.). Surface roughness can be measured and expressed quantitatively.

## Surface grinding 
The workpiece is held on a reciprocating table, which can be varied according to the task, or a rotary-table machine, with continuous or indexed rotation. Indexing allows loading or unloading one station while grinding operations are being performed on another. [2] An alternative term is snow grinding. Disc grinders and double-disc grinders.

Here is one all set up: Feeds and Speeds for a Trochoidal Milling operation to cut a slot. First, you set up the machine, material and tool. We're cutting some mild steel with a 1/2″ 4 flute carbide endmill. Next, you need to tell it the cutting conditions. We're doing a 1/2″ deep slot, so I went with a full 1/2″ of cut depth.

## Difference Between Up Milling and Down Milling
03.06.2019Down Milling. In up milling, cutter rotates against the direction of table feed. In down milling, cutter rotates along the direction of table feed. Chip load on teeth (or uncut chip thickness) increases gradually from zero at the point of engagement to maximum at the point of disengagement. Chip load on teeth (or uncut chip thickness) decreases

## Choosing the right milling machine 
You can also choose a 4-axis milling machine. The fourth axis allows the table to be rotated so that the part can be machined at different angles without needing to be disassembled and replaced manually. Five-axis milling machines also have a spindle rotation axis, which makes it possible to vary the approach angle of the cutter.

## Reciprocal altruism 
Reciprocal altruism. In evolutionary biology, reciprocal altruism is a behaviour whereby an organism acts in a manner that temporarily reduces its fitness while increasing another organism's fitness, with the expectation that the other organism will act in a similar manner at a later time. The concept was initially developed by Robert Trivers

## Mill Speed 
13.1.1.2 Medium-speed mill. Medium-speed mills are smaller than low-speed units and are generally of the vertical spindle construction. The speed of the grinding section of these mills is usually 75–225 rpm. They operate on the principles of crushing and attrition. Pulverization takes place between two surfaces, one rolling on top of the other.

## Reciprocal altruism 
Theory. The concept of reciprocal altruism, as introduced by Trivers, suggests that altruism, defined as an act of helping another individual while incurring some cost for this act, could have evolved since it might be beneficial to incur this cost if there is a chance of being in a reverse situation where the individual who was helped before may perform an altruistic act towards the
