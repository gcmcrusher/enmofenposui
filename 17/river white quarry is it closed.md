My wife and I took friends from Boise, ID to play Quarry Pines yesterday. The course is DRY with marginal grass on the fairways. The greens are VERY burned out and terrible to putt. Front 9 (which includes several holes along the I-10 freeway and along housing developments) is NOT pleasing to play. The back 9 (in the quarry) is quite challenging.

## Ogeechee River protected from a quarry in Hancock Co.
Jan 07, 2021The petition closed with more than 2,000 signatures. In summary: This proposed quarry would pose an everlasting threat to the health of our basin, based on its proximity to Fulsome Creek and the Ogeechee River. Additionally, citizens in the area are reliant on groundwater for drinking.
