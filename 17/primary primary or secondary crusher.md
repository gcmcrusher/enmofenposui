## Gyratory Crusher 
The gyratory crushers crush to reduce the size by a maximum of about one-tenth its size. Usually, metallurgical operations require greater size reduction; hence, the products from the primary crushers are conveyed to secondary or cone crushers where further reduction in size takes place. Here, the maximum reduction ratio is about 8:1.

 These are (i) primary crusher, (ii) secondary crusher, and (iii) tertiary crusher. The primary crusher receives material directly from run of mine (ROM) after blasting and produces the first reduction in size. The output of the primary crusher is fed to a secondary crusher, which further reduces the size of the material. Contact

Jul 26, 2017 Primary and secondary stages involve crushing of coarse materials while the tertiary and quaternary stages involve the reduction of ore particles to finer degrees. Activities at the primary stage will depend on gyratory, jaw or impact crushers. Cone crushers, roll crushers and impact crushers are mostly used at the secondary stages.

## Perfecting the Performance of Secondary Crushers 
Cone crushers are fed with pre-screened material from the primary crusher (usually a jaw crusher or primary gyratory), and the secondary crusher should always, if possible, have a scalped feed. Ideally, the deck on the scalping screen should have a cut point equal to the closed side setting (CSS) of the crusher.
