This method produces rough surfaces and hence used for casting the parts where the upper surface finish has no importance. 2. Bench moulding. In this moulding process, the moulds are prepared on the workbench having a height convenient to the moulder. This method is used for making green sand and dry sand mould.

V-method moulding is also names as vacuum-sealed casting moulding. It is a physical moulding method moulding method that uses plastic film to seal the sand box and relies on the vacuum pump to extract the air inside the mold, resulting in a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the casting mold, and compacting the dry sand to form the required cavity.
