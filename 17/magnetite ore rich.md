Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, deep purple, to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite, limonite or siderite.Hematite is also known as natural ore.

## Seven countries with the largest iron ore reserves in the world
29.06.2021Canada is the world's eighth-largest iron ore-producing country, with output totalling around 54 million tonnes in 2019. 7. India – 5.5 billion tonnes. While comparatively low on the list of countries with the largest iron ore reserves, totalling 5.5 billion tonnes, India punches above its weight in terms of production.

The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite, hematite, goethite, limonite or siderite. The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel. Steel is used

Iron-rich mineral is almost always magnetite. Algoma-type iron ore bodies are relatively small, usually less than 100 meters in thickness and a few kilometers in lateral extent. Algoma-type deposits are mined in the Abitibi greenstone belt (Ontario, Canada), Bjrnevatn (Norway), Kostomuksha (Russian Karelia), etc.

The Day plot diagram was developed for magnetite samples. Can hematite ore be characterised effectively? Measured magnetite-rich samples from Bltberget have multidomain characteristics in remanence, saturation and coercivity. Can these properties be quantified and better linked with grains size, texture and wt% of hematite or magnetite?
