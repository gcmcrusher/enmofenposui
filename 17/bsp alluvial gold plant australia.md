In the 1850s, a third of the world's gold production came from Victoria. The greatest part of that production was alluvial gold, with some from near surface leads or shallow reefs. Victoria, Australia's smallest state, has produced over 2,400 tons of gold, which is 32% of all the gold mined in Australia.
