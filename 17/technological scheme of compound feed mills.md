Jun 08, 2007Grinding of Feedstuffs. Grinding is a major function of feed manufacturing and is by far the most common method of feed processing. It is also the most cheapest and simple process and results in a substantial reduction in particle size and exposure of much more surface area to action of chemicals as well as to the digestive juices.

## Distribution Substations 
Distribution substation A distribution substation transfers power from the transmission system to the distribution system of an area. The input for a distribution substation is typically at least two transmission or subtransmission lines. Distribution voltages are typically medium voltage, between 2.4 and 33 kV depending on the size of the area served and the practices of the local utility.
