When productivity improves the machine produces more output for the same input. The additional output units (e.g. more tones per hour) therefore do not incur additional cost. The cost saving for productivity improvement is therefore the cost per unit (e.g. rands per ton) multiplied by the additional units produced.

## How to Calculate Production Capacity 
21/11/2018The first step in understanding production capacity is to calculate the machine-hour capacity of the factory or manufacturing plant. For example, say that a plant has 50 machines and workers can use the machines from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m., or for 16 hours a day. The daily plant capacity in hours is 16 hours multiplied by 50 machines, or 800
