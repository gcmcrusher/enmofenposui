## Belt Length Calculator
Aug 04, 2020There is a different belt length formula common among engineers. It's an approximation of the one given above: Belt length = ((D L + D S)  π / 2) + (2  L) + (D L - D S) 2 / (4  L). where: D L is the diameter of the large pulley;; D S is the diameter of the smaller pulley; and; L is the distance between the pulley axles.; You can find the belt length calculated with
