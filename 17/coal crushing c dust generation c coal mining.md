## Chute Design For Coal
The principal design objective was to achieve chute flow characteristics that minimize coal spillage, dust generation, and belt wear. This preliminary design will serve as a conceptual baseline for detailed design, fabrication, and testing--both above ground and in a coal mine--of a full size, 90-degree transfer chute between a 36-inch wide
