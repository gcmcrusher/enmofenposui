May 20, 2022Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander. Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

## Gold Dore Refining :the process, machineries and project 
Gold is produced at some mines as part of the process of mining and refining other metals, such as copper. At those operations, gold is refined to an acceptable purity as part of the copper production process. At most gold mines, the gold dore is sent to a refinery for further processing. Under rules established by the London Bullion Market
