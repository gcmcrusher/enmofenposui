Apr 12, 2020What Is the Weight of 1 Cubic Yard of Sand? The approximate weight of 1 cubic yard of sand is 2,600 to 3,000 pounds. This amount is also roughly equal to 1 1/2 tons. A cubic yard of gravel will weigh slightly less, at roughly 2,400 to 2,900 pounds, or roughly still 1 1/2 tons. If covering a 2-inch depth, a cubic yard of sand should cover 100
