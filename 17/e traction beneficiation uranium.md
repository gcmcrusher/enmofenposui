## BENEFICIATION 
In the uranium industry, it does not seem that beneficiation is currently used before chemical treatment. It is a paradox that in the gold mining business in South Africa radioactivity has been used successfully on a large scale to upgrade the mill feed. In these mines, uranium is associated with gold and is directly proportional.

uranium processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Uranium (U), although very dense (19.1 grams per cubic centimetre), is a relatively weak, nonrefractory metal. Indeed, the metallic properties of uranium appear to be intermediate between those of silver and other true metals and those of the nonmetallic elements, so that it is not valued for structural
