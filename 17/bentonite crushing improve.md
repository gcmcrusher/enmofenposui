## Cement Extenders Mechanisms Chemistry 
Apr 23, 2021Bentonite. The most frequently used clay-based cement extenders is bentonite, also known as "gel,". Bentonite has the unusual property of expanding to several times its original volume when placed in water, resulting in higher fluid viscosity, gel strength, and solids-suspending ability. Bentonite is added in concentrations up to 20% BWOC.
