Cassiterite is brittle and the design of the comminution circuit may limit what can be achieved by gravity separation which works best at the coarser sizes. Cassiterite is an oxide mineral and the gangue minerals as well as the quality of the process water will impact the ease of recovery by flotation because the reagent chemistry is not as straightforward as for a sulphide flotation.

Extraction of Tin/ Stannum. Extraction of tin consists of three parts, i.e. tin ore concentration, smelting and refining. Cassiterite is the main source of tin ore, with specific gravity of 6.8-7g/cm 3, density larger than most of gangue. Therefore, 90% of tin concentrate is mainly obtained from cassiterite through gravity separation.

## The search for the optimal sensor 
The sorting of skarn ore with ML-optimized prediction is a good example to illustrate the interaction between sensor-based sorting and downstream processing steps: The unavoidably high content of chlorite in the concentrate is a disadvantage for further processing and chlorite reacts to reagents typically used for the flotation of cassiterite.

## tin flotation
Cassiterite Flotation - Tin Oxide. Jul 06, 2015 The nominal size range for cassiterite flotation is between 2 and 100 microns. The top size is variable depending upon the liberation of the cassiterite particles. Cassiterite grains coarser than 100 microns are difficult to float whilst grains finer than 2 microns give selectivity problems.

## Tin Extraction 
However, the tin concentrate grade of 40% is required, meaning the enrichment of hundreds or thousands times. Targeting at the refractory tin ore, low grade tin concentrate is obtained and it has to be further extracted by special metallurgy process. Reduction smelting is the dominant process to extract tin metal from tin concentrate.

01.08.1985The best concentrate grade was 73.3% of Sn, but the recovery was as low as 8.1% . If, however, the grade was lowered to 12.2% of Sn, the recovery was 68.9%. The finest feed material in jigging tests was minus 1 mm. The result is, that by jigging a coarse, high-grade tin concentrate can be separated.
