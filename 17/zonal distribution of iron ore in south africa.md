## Banded iron formation 
Banded iron formations are almost exclusively Precambrian in age, with most deposits dating to the late Archean ( Ma) with a secondary peak of deposition in the Orosirian period of the Paleoproterozoic (1850 Ma). Minor amounts were deposited in the early Archean and in the Neoproterozoic (750 Ma). The youngest known banded iron formation is an Early Cambrian

Jan 31, 2019Another good example was reported by Brady and Brown (2006) involving gold mining in South Africa. In this case, a catastrophic karst collapse led to a total of 29 fatalities when a three-story crusher plant was swallowed by a sinkhole. The construction of the Chengchao Iron Mine (located in Ezhou City, Hubei Province, China) began in January 1958.

## Geology, Prospecting and Exploration for Iron Ore Deposits
Apr 09, 2015Prospecting involves searching an area for mineral deposits with the view to mine it at a profit. In other words to transform the mineral deposit into an ore deposit. A geologist prospecting an area is looking for surface exposure of minerals, by observing irregularities in colour, shape or rock composition.

South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zaire produce a large portion of the world's gold. Australia is the largest producer of bauxite in the world. It is also the leading producer of gold, diamond, iron ore, tin and nickel. There is just one country, Switzerland that has no known mineral deposit in it. India has deposits of high grade iron ore.

## Safe carriage of Iron ore other iron concentrates in bulk
In the carriage of iron ore, the following precautions should be taken: Iron ores are heavy cargoes which occupy a small area for a large weight, ie they have a low stowage factor (between 0.240.80 m3/tonne). It is therefore important that the tanktop has sufficient strength to carry certain iron ores. If a bulk carrier loads a homogeneous

Somewhat later, Sotho-Tswana people moved south into a large part of Gauteng and the Northwest Province. About 100 years earlier, the ancestors of Nguni-speaking people had moved from East Africa into the KwaZulu-Natal region. These Late Iron Age farmers left huge numbers of stonewalled settlements throughout South Africa.

Southern Africa is set apart from other Subsaharan African regions because of its mineral resources, including copper, diamonds, gold, zinc, chromium, platinum, manganese, iron ore, and coal. Countries in Southern Africa are quite large in physical area, except three smaller landlocked states: Lesotho, Swaziland, and Malawi.

## Iron ore facts 
Key facts. In 2020, Canada was the eighth-largest producer of iron ore in the world. Canada's iron ore is mined in Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut. The top three iron ore-producing countries (Australia, Brazil and China) accounted for 69% of global production. The primary use of iron ore is to make steel, which is 100% recyclable.
