## Artisanal and Small
Jan 12, 2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

## Gold Mining Methods 
Placer mining takes a variety of forms, including panning, sluice-boxing, hydraulic mining, and dredging. All of these techniques use gravity and water to separate the dense gold from the lighter sand and gravel. Some modern commercial placer operations are quite large and utilize heavy equipment and river diversions.

## Environmental Effects Of Gold Mining 
Gold is extracted by using cyanide - a very toxic chemical. A dose the size of a single rice grain can kill you. Some mines use several tons of cyanide every day destroying vast amounts of land. Gold mining also produces large amounts of mercury pollution not to mention cadmium, lead, zinc, copper, arsenic and selenium.
