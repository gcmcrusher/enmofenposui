## Quick Answer: Do You Need Gravel Under Concrete Driveway
Is gravel required under concrete slab? Even though you can pour concrete over dirt it's not recommended. You should use any type of gravel and this really comes down to the homeowner and the subgrades. Having a gravel layer helps keep the slabs even, prevents cracks, helps with water drains and helps avoid low spots within the subgrade.

## Cement Types
Chemical testing includes oxide analyses (SiO 2, CaO, Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3, etc.) to allow the cement phase composition to be calculated. Type II cements are limited in C150/M 85 to a maximum of 8 percent by mass of tricalcium aluminate (a cement phase, often abbreviated C 3 A), which impacts a cement's sulfate resistance. Certain oxides are

## Cement Manufacturing Process 
Aug 30, 2012Cement Manufacturing Process Phase 1: Raw Material Extraction. Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. Such raw materials are limestone, clay and sand. Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand clay fulfill the need of silicon, iron and aluminum.
