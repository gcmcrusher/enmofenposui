## Iron Ore Beneficiation Technology By Electrostatic Separation
Almost 100% of mined iron ore is used in steel production, making it essential for everything from staples to buildings. Beneficiation is the term for reducing the size of valuable iron ore particles and separating them from the gange (unusable minerals), which are then discarded. There are several different methods of wet and dry separation.
