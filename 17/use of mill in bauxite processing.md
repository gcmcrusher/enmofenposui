## The Process of Mining Bauxite 
27.02.2019Milling: Several meters of rock and clay are removed by blasting, drilling, and bulldozers. The bauxite is then transported to the crushing and washing area, reducing the particle size and increasing the available surface area for the digestion stage. The material that is discharged from the mill is called slurry.

Bauxite can be found in a number of different physical forms including: pisolitic, friable and hardcap. Each bauxite will have its own distinctive crushing and milling characteristics. Bauxite can be highly variable through the mine pit profile, both vertically and horizontally. Often large blocks from blasted or ripped bauxite can be upto 12 m 3

The process of comminution is the crushing and grinding of a material / ore to reduce it to smaller or finer particles. The comminution process reduces particle sizes by breaking, crushing, or grinding of ore, rock, coal, or other materials. The process is most often used in the field of mining and / or mineral processing, where mineral ore is broken down into small
