## Coal
In the first four months of 2021, the share was 66.5%, higher than in the same period in 2019 and 2020. In early 2021, coal-fired generation in India climbed to a monthly share of 79% of the power mix, the highest level since early 2019, as hydropower and wind availabilities were low and demand growth was met by coal-fired generation.

The combination of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy in the coal quality analysis was reported formerly. But in the practical test of the prototype instrument in the real power plant, the X-ray fluorescence signals suffered from intensity fluctuations over long-time measurements.
