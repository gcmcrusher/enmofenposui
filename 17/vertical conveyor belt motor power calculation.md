## Belt Conveyor Drive 
Jul 29, 2022Drive arrangement: In belt conveyors the driving power is transmitted to the belt by the driving pulley which is rotated by an electric motor. The basic mechanism of transmission of power from the pulley to the belt is based on the theory of friction drive.. The fundamental equation for a belt conveyor drive is given by: (The Euler's equation). T 1 ≤ T 2.e α

## Motor Sizing Basics Part 1: How to Calculate Load Torque
To calculate load torque, multiply the force (F) by the distance away from the rotational axis, which is the radius of the pulley (r) . If the mass of the load (blue box) is 20 Newtons, and the radius of the pulley is 5 cm away, then the required torque for the application is 20 N x 0.05 m = 1 Nm. Typically, a safety factor is used so that the

When planning for a conveyor system design, there are numerous factors that need to be taken into account. These calculators are designed to assist in working out safe incline angles, conveyor heights, and other useful measurements. The box tumbling calculator gives the maximum angle at which products can safely be transported without tumbling.
