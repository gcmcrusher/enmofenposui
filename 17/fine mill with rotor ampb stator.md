The feed product is conveyed into the cutting chamber by gravity or by a nip-roll device. The material is cut between the rotor- and stator knives of the SECOMY S, which operate against each other in a special cutting sequence with a defined gap. The cutting continues until the material is fine enough to pass through the classifier wheel.
