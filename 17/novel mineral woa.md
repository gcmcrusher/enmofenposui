One of the main drawbacks that limits the application of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) in dental field is its long setting time. Mineral trioxide aggregate with accelerated setting properties and excellent chemical–physical and biological properties is still required. In this study, an innovative mineral trioxide aggregate, which consists of calcium silicates, calcium aluminates,

Jun 15, 2022The WOA algorithm reproduces greater FSI values comparing to the GWO algorithm. As shown in Figs. 9c–d, by comparing the WOA and GWO algorithms, the extent of the high and very high susceptibility classes is larger in the GWO algorithm. When the goal of flood susceptibility mapping is for reducing the casualties, the WOA algorithm is preferable.
