## Recycled concrete fines and aggregates
The prototype Smart Crusher, termed Smart Crusher 1 (SC 1) was used to crush concrete samples from the same batch as previously crushed using the conventional jaw crusher. The material was pre-crushed, using the smart crusher at its maximum opening size, in order to simulate the pre-crushing that recycled concrete is submitted to on a larger scale.

3. Warm the subgrade before placing concrete on it during cold weather. 4. Avoid placing a slab directly on polyethylene film or other vapor barriers. Use a 100-mm (4-in.) layer of compactible, drainable fill (not sand). A "crusher run" material, usually graded from 38 mm to 50 mm (1-1/2 in. to 2 in.) down to rock dust, is suitable.
