Sand separator in sewage treatment plant in Wieluń. A sand separator is a device that separates sand or other solids from water . One version of sand separator utilizes centrifugal force to separate sand or other heavy particles out of the water. The separated material drops down into a tank or reservoir where it can be removed later or in the

Jul 19, 2022The separation method is based on the fact that crop plant stalks and chaff are soft materials, whereas grains are extremely hard. Because stalk and chaff are soft, they can be broken into pieces when beaten, but the grains are unaffected. Winnowing can be used to separate sand from sawdust or sand from dried leaves.
