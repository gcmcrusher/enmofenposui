The vertical milling machine is again sub-divided in two types: (a) Bed Mill: In bed mills, spindle always moves parallel to its own axis while the table moves perpendicular to the axis of the spindle. (b) Turret Mill: In turret mills, spindle is in stationary position and table is moved in such a way that it will always perpendicular and parallel to the axis of the spindle during the cutting

## Vertical Milling Machine 
The Milling Machine uses a rotating milling cutter to produce machined surfaces by progressively removing material from a work piece. The vertical milling machine also can function like a drill press because the spindle is perpendicular to the table and can be lowered into the work piece.

## Horizontal vs. Vertical Milling: Which Is Best For Your Metalwork 
Aug 17, 2016Vertical Mills features spindles (cutting elements) that are aligned vertically. Horizontal Mills have a spindle that is parallel to the ground. Although the job of both machine types is the same, the production method of job completion looks a little differently. There are pros and cons to both machining choices, and it's important to note

## Vertical Machining Center (VMC) 
A vertical machining center (VMC) corresponds to the machining center where the spindl e axis and the worktable are vertical. In this case, it may conduct all kinds of vertical machining such as milling, drilling, boring, tapping, thread cutting, and more operations. Usually, these machinings are famous for vertical machines.

## vertical milling machine advantages
Vertical milling machines must use smaller cutting tools than horizontal mills because they have less rigid, less massive castings and lower horsepower motors. Still, they can accomplish the same end results as the horizontal mill, just more slowly. Read On. On a vertical machine such as a gantry mill, that can make sweeping between cycles an essential part of the process.

## Comparing the Different Types of Milling Machines
24.06.2020Vertical Milling Machine. A vertical milling machine is defined by the vertical orientation of its cutting tool. The cutting tool is placed on a vertical spindle that can be raised or lower. When lowered, it will press into the underlying workpiece, allowing it to remove material. When raised, the cutting tool will pull away from the workpiece.
