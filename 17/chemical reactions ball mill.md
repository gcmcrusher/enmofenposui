## Chemical Reactions By Ball Milling 
Ball milling is one of central techniques of mechanochemical synthesis, that is, chemical synthesis by the action of mechanical force, such as by grinding, stretching, or shearing. Mechanisms underlying chemical reactions in ball milling involve abrasion, shearing, and friction, making ball-milling chemistry one of central areas in tribochemistry.

## Ball Milling Towards Green Synthesis (RSC Publishing)
Ball milling has emerged as a powerful tool over the past few years for effecting chemical reactions by mechanical energy. Allowing a variety of reactions to occur at ambient temperatures and in solvent-free conditions, ball milling presents a greener route for many chemical processes. Compared to the use of microwave and ultrasound as energy sources

## Mechanical Milling: What Is It And How Does It Work? 
Sep 15, 2017Mechanical milling is the process of taking a powder mixture, placing it in a ball mill and then subjecting it to high-energy collision from the balls. The method is done to produce a fine dispersion of oxide particles from the material used. Mechanical milling can modify the conditions of how chemical reactions typically take place by changing
