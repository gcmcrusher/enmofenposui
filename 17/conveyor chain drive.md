## Chain Conveyors 
Chain conveyors are generally used to convey heavy pallets and racks. The load requires a bottom surface that can be carried directly on the chain strands. A wear bar is used to support the chain and the chain strands are driven by a center drive. Capacities range from small light weight loads up to large racks weighing several thousand pounds

## Chain Conveyor Speed Calculation 
Mar 22, 2017The large driven sprocket is mounted on the same shaft as conveyor sprocket so it must also turn at 0.405 rpm. The required rpm of the small sprocket can be calculated from the ratio of the pitch diameters.. = 0.405  461/106.14. = 1.76rpm. Using the tooth ratio should also give a similar answer.. = 0.405  57/13. = 1.78rpm.
