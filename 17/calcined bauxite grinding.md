## 
The bauxite ore is used to produce aluminum metal, and often contains gallium deposition, so it is also a source of gallium. The industrial extraction of aluminum from bauxite is performed using the Bayer process. Calcined bauxite is produced by calcination of bauxite ore at 900 to 1700 C by a rotary kiln or multiple hearth furnace kiln

## Uses of Bauxite 
Aluminium oxide sandpaper, polishing powders, and polishing solutions are all made from calcined alumina. Bauxite that has been sintered is commonly used as a sandblasting abrasive. It's made by grinding bauxite into a powder and fusing it into spherical beads at a high temperature. These beads are extremely tough and long-lasting.

Calcined Bauxite is obtained by calcining (heating) superior grade Bauxite at high temperature (from 850 C to 1600 C). This removes moisture thereby increasing the alumina content. Compared to an alumina content of about 57 % to 58 % in raw Bauxite, Calcined Bauxite has an alumina content of 84 % to 88 %.
