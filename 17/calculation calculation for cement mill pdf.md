## Cement Manufacturing Process Flow Chart
The process of making cement is described in this flow chart. The two raw materials used in storage basins. The two materials are mixed in the correct proportion and ground in a tube mill (This mixture is known as slurry) and stirred in a correcting basin. It is then stored in a storage tank. From there, it is fed into the rotary kiln where

Feb 16, 2015The most important first step in controlling energy consumption is to be aware of the relative importance of the process areas where most energy is consumed. Figure 2 shows a typical breakdown of electrical energy consumption at a cement plant. The most obvious area for attention is that of grinding, both raw and cement.
