## Beginner's Guide to Coal Mining 
Aug 12, 2022A mining company will need tools for exploration, extraction, and remediation or reclamation at mining sites. Miners use hydraulic shovels called power shovels to dig out coal, clear debris, and remove rocks in surface and underground mining. Miners use a range of vehicles such as bulldozers, mining trucks, and loaders.

In particular, surface mining is used to retrieve sand, gravel, stones, coal, iron and other metals. There are five recognized types of surface mining, each with specific variations depending on the minerals being extracted. These include strip mining, open-pit mining, mountaintop removal, dredging and highwall mining.

Nov 28, 2016MIT's accidental smelting discovery unlocks the potential of antimony. The ancient Egyptians used it in black eye make-up and alchemists marvelled at antimony's semi-metallic properties. Now, a groundbreaking smelting technique could open up new opportunities for antimony, as well as other metals. Nnamdi Anyadike investigates.

## Surface mining – strip, open pit, mountaintop removal, dredging
Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed. It is the other way of underground mining, in which the overlying rock is left behind, and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.. Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to
