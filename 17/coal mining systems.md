because of the dangers faced in coal mining systems. For example, in coal mines there is a danger of presence of highly toxic gases, and also the increase in temperature inside the coal mine could be a real threat, hence implementing a safety system for the coal mine workers as well as to protect the resources inside those mines.

A spark, which could easily come from a miner's axe or a candle could spell disaster. Underground pit collapses were also common as the mines were only supported by wooden props. In 1841 about 216,000 people were employed in the mines in Britain. Most coal was mined in the north and the north-east as well as the Midlands and some parts of

Coal seams as much as five metres thick can be mined in a single "lift" by the longwall method, and seams up to seven metres thick have been extracted by conventional mining systems in one pass. However, when a seam exceeds these thicknesses, its extraction usually involves dividing the seam into a number of slices and mining each slice

In the modern coal mining plant, we often use steel cord rubber belt conveyor to move coal in underground. Underground coal mining is one of the oldest forms of mining. This type of underground mining took a lot of planning, where tunnels were built to and from ventilation shafts and rail shafts to allow for transporting coal with belt conveyor.

## Coal 
29/07/2022Coal Mining Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.

## Coal Mines in the Industrial Revolution 
31.03.2015Before the Industrial Revolution, two types of mines existed: drift mines and bell pits. Both were small-scale coal mines and the coal which came from these type of pits was used locally in homes and local industry. However, as the country started to industrialise itself, more and more coal was needed to fuel steam engines and furnaces.

## Coal Mining Methods 
The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 requires that mine entries consist of at least three parallel passageways (three-entry systems), so that if one is accidentally blocked the others afford a means of escape; at least one provides an airway for mine ventilation. However, the Act allows a mining company to use two
