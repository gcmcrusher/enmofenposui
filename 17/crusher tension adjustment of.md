## What is a Jaw Crusher 
The working principle of jaw crushers: When working, the motor drives the belt and pulley to move the movable jaw up and down through the eccentric shaft. When the movable jaw rises, the angle between the toggle plate and the movable jaw becomes larger, thereby pushing the movable jaw plate closer to the fixed jaw plate, and the material passes

Apr 06, 2021Spoke tension is the amount of pulling force being exerted along a spoke. It is typically measured and called out by component companies in Kilograms of force (kgf), or in Newtons (N). When truing or dishing a wheel, the mechanic is making adjustments that affect spoke tension. However, spoke tension isn't just about individual spokes.
