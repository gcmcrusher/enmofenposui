At the most basic level, phosphorus is an element. Phosphorus is one of the core building blocks of organic molecules. All life needs phosphorus, including humans, plants, and animals. In lakes and rivers, plants and algae need phosphorus to grow. Often times, the amount of phosphorus determines how much and how fast they can grow.

Luckily, Blue Economy and Biomimicry have been systemically designing since the 1970s, so the answers are readily available. We can design with scope instead of just scale. We can scale in fractals. And we can put a big WHY in the core of our design. Life, health, and freedom for all. Full autonomy combined with responsibility.

## Mining Plants 
Metal is a material that has made a strong indentation into our world–from being a part of the phones we use to making up medical equipment. While metals are most commonly found through mining the Earth's crust, a new method of accessing it has recently emerged. This method is called phytomining, the process of extracting minerals from hyper-accumulating plants.

## What is phytomining? ECO
Phytomining is the process by which metals are extracted from plants instead of mined out of the Earth. There are around 700 species of plants known as "hyperaccumulators" that overtime suck the soil dry of metals like nickel, zinc, cobalt and even gold. This might seem as a far-fetched dream, however in Malaysia locals have been harvesting

Enjoy the update, and report any bugs in the comments below. I haven't tested much for this version since it's in essence a copy paste of the main version, 1.15.2, but it seems to work ok. I'll probably move to 1.16.4 entirely sooner or later, since 1.15.2 doesn't seem very popular, but until then this version will be the buggier one :/

Biomining is the technique of extracting metals from ores and other solid materials typically using prokaryotes, fungi or plants ( phytoextraction also known as phytomining or biomining).

## copper extraction and purification 
The purification uses an electrolyte of copper (II) sulphate solution, impure copper anodes, and strips of high purity copper for the cathodes. The diagram shows a very simplified view of a cell. At the cathode, copper (II) ions are deposited as copper. At the anode, copper goes into solution as copper (II) ions.
