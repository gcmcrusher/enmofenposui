Why bauxite is an important mineral? Bauxite is used in manufacture of aluminium which being light in nature finds its use in aircraft.. What makes bauxite special? It is a rock composed mainly of aluminum-bearing minerals.It forms when laterite soils are severely leached of silica and other soluble materials in a wet tropical or subtropical climate.

## Bauxite 
Bauxite is the primary source for aluminum (Al). Ores in this group include aluminum hydroxides, gibbsite, boehmite and diaspore. It is not just the concentration of aluminum that is important for bauxite mining, but also the identification of penalty elements such as iron oxide that may also make overall compositional analysis more challenging.
