## Calcium sulfate 
Calcium sulfate (or calcium sulphate) is the inorganic compound with the formula CaSO 4 and related hydrates.In the form of Î³-anhydrite (the anhydrous form), it is used as a desiccant.One particular hydrate is better known as plaster of Paris, and another occurs naturally as the mineral gypsum.It has many uses in industry. All forms are white solids that are poorly soluble in water.

Aluminium oxide-coated pumice (AOCP) reduced fluoride concentration, from 5.0 0.2 to 1.5 mg/L. Thermal treatment of AOCP showed reduced fluoride removal efficiency, and the maximum capacity was found to be 7.87 mg/g [103]. Crushed limestone was used to remove fluoride from pre-acidified water as shown by Nath and Dutta [104].
