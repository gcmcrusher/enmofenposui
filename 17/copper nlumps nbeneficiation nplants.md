## 12.5: FLOTATION PRACTICE IN BENEFICIATION OF SULFIDE COPPER AND COPPER 
Copper sulfide ores with medium pyrite content contain up to 50% sulfides, the average sulfide content is about 15% Fe 2 S. Some of these ores may underline porphyry copper deposits known as a high-pyrite hypogene ore type. In other cases, they appear as copper scarns (Antamina-Peru copper ore) or stringer ores, which sometimes are pockets or

Sep 08, 2021Separation flotation method can also achieve good results for refractory oxidized copper ore. It is to crush the mineral to a certain particle size, mix 0.1% ~ 1.0% salt and 0.5% ~ 2.0% pulverized coal, and heat it to about 900 ℃ in oxygen isolation. The copper in the ore will precipitate on the carbon particle surface in metal state.
