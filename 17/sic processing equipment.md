Nov 29, 2013Oxidation. A beneficial feature of SiC processing technology is that SiC can be thermally oxidized to form SiO 2. When a thermal oxide of thickness x is grown, 0.5 x of the SiC surface is consumed, and the excess carbon leaves the sample as CO.

## Oxide Reliability of SiC MOS Devices 
Oct 12, 2008In this paper, we report that the thermally grown gate oxide on 4H-SiC is intrinsically reliable even at temperature as high as 375C. We further show that even with the current SiC processing technology, devices with 10 cm2 active area can still achieve 100-year lifetime E2.9MV/cm and 375C.
