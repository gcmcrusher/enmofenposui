Ammonium Nitrate Facts and Uses. Dec 22, 2018 Ammonium nitrate is the nitrate salt of the ammonium cation. It may be considered the ammonium analog to potassium nitrate or saltpeter. Its chemical formula is NH 4 NO 3 or N 2 H 4 O 3. In pure form, ammonium nitrate is a crystalline white solid that readily dissolves in water.

Nope, potassium nitrate is for black powder. Ammonium nitrate is an explosive and certain combinations of things can sensitize it to shock. If it burns too hot it will also explode. Don't play around with it. Lacking any other source, find some stump remover for your KNO3 source. Ammonium nitrate isn't an explosive.

The first commercial ammonia plant based on the Haber-Bosch process was built by BASF at Oppau, Germany. The plant went on-stream on Sept. 9, 1913, with a production capacity of 30 m.t./day. Figure 1 is a flowsheet of the first commercial ammonia plant. The reactor contained an internal heat exchanger in addition to those shown on the schematic.
