## Feldspar Value, Price, and Jewelry Information
Feldspars are the most common minerals at the Earth's surface. In fact, if the entire composition of the Earth's crust were regarded as a single mineral, it would calculate out almost exactly as a feldspar. The feldspars are complex aluminosilicate minerals containing K, Na, and Ca, with some rarer types rich in Ba.
