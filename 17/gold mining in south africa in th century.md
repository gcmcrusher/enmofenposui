The Witwatersrand Gold Rush was a major contributing factor of the failed Jameson Raid of 1895 to 1896, and of the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899. British resentment over the Boer control of the Witwatersrand resulted in the British owners of the mines organising the overthrow of the Boer government.

Although some mining had taken place in what is now South Africa centuries before Europeans arrived, 1 the modern mining industry emerged as the major shaper of South Africa's economy and race relations in the latter half of the 19 th century.

Aug 12, 2022According to the report, the country's seasonally adjusted mining production decreased by 3.4% in the second quarter of 2022 compared with the first quarter of 2022, mainly due to the lower production of gold, coal, manganese ore and diamonds. Victoria Gold reports net income of $17.1 million in Q2, reduces production expectations for 2022.
