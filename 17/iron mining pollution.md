## Environmental Impacts of Mining 
The environmental impacts from mining include: Destruction of natural habitat. Oil, fuel and chemicals spills contaminating surrounding soil, rivers and groundwater resources. Air pollution from mining processing operations. Drainage and runoff from mining sites, including acid mine drainage. Acid mine drainage can go on for thousands of years.

14/03/2014The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

## Harmful Effects of Iron Oxides 
27/07/2017In mining states like Pennsylvania, iron mines flooded with water spill gallons of iron oxide into ponds, rivers and lakes; this can poison fish and pollute the environment. The iron molecules react with oxygen to create a solid iron oxide known as yellow boy, which sinks to the bottom of rivers and waterways to pollute them.
