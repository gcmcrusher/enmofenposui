2. The larger sizes will require less mixing water and hence, for a given cement factor, will produce concrete of lower water-ratio than the smaller sizes. 3. The advantage of small aggregate in the water-ratio strength relationship may or may not be sufficient to offset the effects of its higher mixing water demand.
