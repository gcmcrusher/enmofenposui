## Application of Biohydrometallurgy to Copper Mining in Zambia: 
Copper output and price movements in Zambia's mining history [9]. Biohydrometallurgy is essentially the application of biotechnology to processing minerals [8, 10]. Technically, the process is a branch of hydrometallurgy, but it involves the use of microorganisms to biooxidise sulphide minerals ore from low-grade copper ore deposits [11]. The

Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process, beginning with the mining and concentrating of low-grade ores containing copper sulfide minerals, and followed by smelting and electrolytic refining to produce a pure copper cathode. An increasing share of copper is produced from acid leaching of oxidized ores. Copper is one of the oldest metals
