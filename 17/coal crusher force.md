The breaker plate of a coal crusher has holes therein so that coal small enough to pass through those holes does so without being acted upon by the rotor. This increases the capacity of the crusher, reduces fines, and conserves power. The plate is oriented such that windage generated by the rotor urges the smaller pieces of coal through the holes.

15.09.2014For the 1-in. screen below the roll crusher the capacity has no correction factor and the area needed is 32/2.1 = 15.2 sq ft. To handle the output from a 40 x 24 roll crusher the screen will have to be at least 24 in. wide. Perhaps it will be more effective to use one continuous screen of at least 20.1 + 15.2 = 35.3 sq ft.
