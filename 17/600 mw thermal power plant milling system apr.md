## Saudi Arabia to add 3.7 GW in solar power, achieves world's lowest price
Apr 13, 2021Author. Igor Todorović. As Saudi Arabia connected a 300 MW photovoltaic facility to the grid, it revealed deals have just been signed for the construction of seven solar power plants with a combined capacity of almost 3.7 GW. One of the power purchase agreements sets the price at just USD 10.4 per MWh, a level unseen before in the industry.

Fig. 3 shows the thermal power plant integrated with the solar feed water heating system that uses direct steam generating parabolic trough collectors (DSG system). Steam is generated directly in parabolic trough collectors without the need for an intermediate heat transfer fluid. There are two sections of parabolic trough collectors: preheating and evaporating sections.

## Steam Turbines 
Since the market introduction of steam power plants with ultra-super critical steam conditions 20 years ago the majority of projects has mainly been on units larger than 600 MW. For these, the applied turbo sets consist of a high pressure and a medium pressure expansion arranged in separate turbine casings.

## Boiler Repair and Maintenance Services 
Whether you operate a 600 MW plant, or a pulp paper production plant, your boiler is exposed to high temperature gases that can cause tube corrosion or erosion. At GE, we have a deep understanding of how boilers work, regardless of the fuel or application, and we have developed a unique thermal spray cladding.
