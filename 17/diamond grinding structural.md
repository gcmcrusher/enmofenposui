## The Basics: Diamond Sintered Bond 
The Process. Like all diamond tools, diamond grit is suspended or held within a matrix. In the case of the sintered bond, the matrix is comprised of varying metal powders subjected to high heat and high pressure fusing the matrix and diamond grit into a solid metal segment. The resulting piece is a multi-layered segment designed to grind.
