01/09/2021Soft coal is also known as brown coal or lignite. China produces more hard coal than any other country by a factor of about three. The whopping 3,162 million metric tons of hard coal produced by China dwarfs the output of the second and third-ranked producers—the U.S. at 932 million metric tons and India at 538 million metric tons.

## What are the uses of lignite coal? 
Where is lignite coal used? Lignite has the lowest ranking in the coal classification system, and it is mostly used as fuel in the power sector. Lignite's colour ranges from brown to black (see Figure 2.7) and its heating value is less than 19.306 KJ/Kg. Due to the fact that lignite deposits are geologically young they may contain plant debris.
