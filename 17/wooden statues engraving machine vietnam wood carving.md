## Learn how to engrave wood with the Cricut Maker!
Aug 28, 2020The Cricut Maker can cut basswood, balsa wood, as well as wood veneer. I recommend the basswood for this project as it is a stronger wood and works best for engraving.

Oct 08, 2014Apply the same varnish in the gutter. (I find this process is skip-able. Sometime, your tape gets too wet because of the varnish and won't work well later when you try filling the paint.)

Aug 15, 2016For small carvings, get a mildly grained (figured) wood. Otherwise, the grain will dominate the carving detail.
