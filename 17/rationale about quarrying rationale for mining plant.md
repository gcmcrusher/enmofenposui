## Mining and Quarrying 
Mining: An Overview. Minerals and mineral products are the backbone of most industries. Some form of mining or quarrying is carried out in virtually every country in the world. Mining has important economic, environmental, labour and social effects—both in the countries or regions where it is carried out and beyond.

## The Potential Negative Effects Of Mining On The Environment, 
Sep 28, 2018Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants. This can lead to air pollution via air contaminants, release of greenhouse gases like methane and CO2

## Health And Safety In Quarrying 
The quarrying industry is a noisy industry. The QPA3 states that typical noise levels could be between 89–108dB (A) for a primary crusher and 106–110dB (A) for hand drills. The principle health effect of being exposed to high levels of noise
