## Ball Mill 
D. Sumanth Kumar, H.M. Mahesh, in Synthesis of Inorganic Nanomaterials, 2018 3.6.1.1 Ball Milling. A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend bulk material into QDs/nanosize using different sized balls. The working principle is simple; impact and attrition size reduction take place as the ball drops from near the top of a rotating hollow cylindrical shell.

14.01.2019Materials suitable down to -100 C. Low carbon, 3.5%-nickel steels are often used in liquid gas storage tanks at temperatures down to -100C. Many aluminium, nickel, and titanium alloys are also suitable for these temperatures. Aluminium 7076-T6 can also be used up to -128 C, but not for critical applications.
