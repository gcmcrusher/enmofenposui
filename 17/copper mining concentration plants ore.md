Jan 08, 2019MINING ON PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND. An increased quantity of copper ore was mined on Prince William Sound in 1915, but the average grade of the ore fell from $12.60 a ton in 1914 to about $8.07 in 1915. The total production of copper, gold, and silver from the copper ores was for each metal less than in 1914, but because of the high price of copper
