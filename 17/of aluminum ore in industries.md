## Aluminium Mining And Processing 
Aluminium is mined from bauxite-contained mining areas since the production of aluminium is entirely reliable on extraction from bauxite. It is not found in free form and is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust. Bauxite is the only ore containing 20-25 percent of aluminium from where the metal is extracted and commercially

## Aluminum Ore Mining in China 
The Aluminum Ore Mining industry in China consists of enterprises that mine bauxite, the principal ore of aluminum, and process raw materials such as washing and ore dressing. More than 90% of bauxite is further processed into alumina, with the remainder used as refractory materials, abrasive materials and raw materials for high-alumina cement.

## Environmentally sustainable and cost
Aug 01, 20201. Introduction. Bauxite is the mineral rocks containing hydrates of aluminum oxides which is the major and primary source of aluminum (Bray, 2017; Valeton, 1972).Worldwide, bauxite ore is a principal source to produce more than 95% of alumina, but its price always remained high due to the costs associated with its extraction process.

It can be seen from the figure that the specific tensile strength of carbon fiber is about 3.8 times that of aluminum, and the specific stiffness is 1.71 times that of aluminum.

## 12.1 Primary Aluminum Production 
Primary aluminum production begins with the mining of bauxite ore, a hydrated oxide of aluminum consisting of 30 to 56 percent alumina (A l2O3) and lesser amounts of iron, silicon, and titanium. The ore is refined into alumina by the Bayer process. The alumina is then shipped to a primary aluminum plant for electrolytic reduction to aluminum.
