## Flow measurement of zinc electrolyte in a zinc plating plant
Measurement requirements. For zinc plating the electro-galvanising process is used. In this electroplating process, zinc is deposited on the steel sheets in a zinc bath by the aid of an electric current. The steel sheets are immersed in a bath with zinc electrolyte, an aqueous and acidic medium, at a temperature of +63C / +145.4F.

## Natural Colonization of Plants on Five Lead/Zinc Mine Tailings in 
07/03/2005Mine tailings can have a specific assemblage of plant species due to their unique physicochemical properties, and this process can be important in developing ecological theory and restoration practice. Physicochemical properties and natural colonization of plants on five lead/zinc (Pb/Zn) mine tailings in southern China were investigated.

The contaminants of greatest concern are arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead and zinc. These contaminants are harmful or toxic to aquatic life, plants, and wildlife, and can accumulate in the tissue of plants and animals. The Palmerton Zinc Pile has been designated by the Environmental Protection Agency as a Superfund site.

## zinc processing 
Zinc ores are widely distributed throughout the world, although more than 40 percent of the world's output originates in North America and Australia. The common zinc-containing minerals are the zinc sulfide known as zinc blende or sphalerite (ZnS), a ferrous form of zinc blende known as marmatite [(ZnFe)S], and a zinc carbonate known as calamine or smithsonite
