Manganese nodules are black lumps the size of potatoes found lying unattached on the floor of the ocean at a depth of 4 000-6 000 metres. These nodules are especially valuable to industry because of their manganese content, but they also contain metals such as copper, nickel, cobalt, lithium, molybdenum and titanium. Economically interesting sites
