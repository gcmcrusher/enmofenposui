Railway ballast is one of the most essential and demanding purposes for crushed stone, as it is vital for railroad infrastructure. It looks very much like regular gravel, but in truth it is much sturdier. It has to be in order to act as a support base for the railroad ties. Railway ballast also allows for the drainage of water away from the rails.
