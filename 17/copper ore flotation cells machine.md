The sulfide ores are beneficiated in flotation cells, while the oxide ores are generally leached. First the copper ore from a open pit mine is blasted, loaded and transported to the primary crushers. Then the ore is crushed and screened, with the fine sulfide ore (~-0.5 mm) going to froth flotation cells for recovery of copper.

Jul 05, 2022Grinding particle size. During the flotation process, the flotation effect of too coarse ore particles (greater than 0.1mm) and extremely fine ore particles (less than 0.006mm) is not good, and the recovery rate is low. 1. In the coarse flotation, due to the large weight, the shedding force of the ore particles increases.

## 6 QA about Flotation Cell 
23.12.2021In flotation practice, c orrect selection of flotation cell is beneficial to improve flotation efficiency and save energy consumption. The basic principles of flotation machine type selection are as follows: (1) Ore Properties. On the premise that the ore is easy to separate and the aeration is not large, the mechanical agitation flotation machine can be used.
