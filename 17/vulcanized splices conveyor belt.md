## Splice Insights: What Is Splicing? 
So when it's time to install the belt on a conveyor system, the ends have to be joined together, which is a process known as splicing. You may also know that the splice is most often the weakest point of a conveyor system, and relies on two equally important factors; 1) The skill of the person making the splice and 2) The quality of the

## Definition of Conveyor Belt Splicing 
11/09/2019Vulcanization requires a lot of time and thus more downtime for the conveyor belt system. Many environments and types of belts do not allow for cohesive vulcanized splices. Vulcanized belts offer less a chance for sift-through of materials being carried on the belt. Mechanical splices are easier to inspect for damage.

Quality Cuts. Proper application begins with flawless cuts and the preparation of the belt ends. Quality equipment is essential as is using careful precision when cutting the conveyor material. The belt should be cut at a bias angle, typically 22 degrees. After being cut, the ends are pulled apart to expose the various plies that must be joined.

Also, use the HIC method to ensure durability of the splice. V-shaped (aka diamond shaped) joints make for a stronger splice and are highly recommended. The additional length needed for endlessing should be calculated using this formula: Splice Length = W + 150 (N-2) + 25mm. Here, W is width of belt (in mm), N is the number of plies.

03/02/2021Vulcanized splicing is a means in which to join the open ends of a conveyor belt to create one continuous loop. Often times, the means in which a vulcanized splice is executed, is left with little regard from both the customer and the service provider. When this occurs, the overall value and performance of the belt is negatively affected.

## Textile Conveyor Belt Splice Systems
Textile conveyor belts are spliced by vulcanization, by glueing or by means of mechanical fasteners. In many regions of the world, mechanical fasteners are the first choice because it is a cheap and fast way of connecting two belt ends. Nevertheless, mechanical fasteners do not achieve the static and dynamic splice strengths of vulcanized
