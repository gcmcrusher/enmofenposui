## How the Early

## Riffles and Sluice Boxes 
The reason that riffles work is two fold. First, there is an eddy created behind each riffle, causing a temporary lull in the water flow. The material that is flowing is in a liquid state. This causes the heavies to be at the very bottom of the flow. As the flow passes over a riffle, the heavies will fall to the bottom behind a riffle.

A ratio of 2.5:1 is perhaps 'perfect'. In other words, if you're feeding the sluice 1/4" gravels the maximum riffle height should be 3/4" or less as an example.
