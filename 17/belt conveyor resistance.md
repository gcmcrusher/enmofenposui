overland conveyors typically follow the terrain resulting in several sections of different inclinations, bents and turns of different radii. Figure 1 – Overland Coal Belt Conveyor, Tiangin, China – Plan View (Alspaugh, 2004) Figure 1 shows an example of an overland belt conveyor moving coal from a stockpile to a shiploader.

## Materials conveyors: A guide for specifying belt conveyor systems
Jan 26, 2021The first step in the design of a belt conveyor with a specified conveyor capacity is to determine the speed and width of the belt. The magnitude of the belt speed can be determined using: equation. Where: C = Conveyor capacity. r = Material density (kg/m3) V = Belt speed (m/s) A = Conveyor's belt cross-sectional area.
