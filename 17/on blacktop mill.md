The three basic components of a milling machine are: Cutting drum. Vacuum. Conveyance system. The cutting drum rotates cutting heads across the surface, chewing up the existing asphalt to the depth of the cutting heads. The vacuum sucks up the milled material and deposits it where the conveyance system can then move it to a dump truck.
