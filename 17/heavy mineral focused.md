## Ilmenite: An ore of titanium 
Ilmenite is a black iron-titanium oxide with a chemical composition of FeTiO 3. Ilmenite is the primary ore of titanium, a metal needed to make a variety of high-performance alloys. Most of the ilmenite mined worldwide is used to manufacture titanium dioxide, TiO 2, an important pigment, whiting, and polishing abrasive. Heavy Mineral Sand

## The use of heavy mineral chemistry in 
The multivariate discrimination of the detrital garnets reveals the dominance of granulite and amphibolite facies source rocks. Rutile compositions indicate subordinate inputs from mafic sources across the investigated sedimentary succession. The single‐grain analysis of heavy minerals, therefore, infers a wide variation in source rock types.
