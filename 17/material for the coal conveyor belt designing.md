Belt conveyors can be used to stock-pile or reclaim bulk materials. Radial stackers are used for creating large piles of materials such as wood chips, coal or ore. Reclaim belt conveyors are located under the piles to carry the materials into the plant for processing. Belt conveyors require less horsepower to operate than other types of conveyors.
