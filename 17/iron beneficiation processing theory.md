## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, Extraction Methods
27.09.2021The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

## iron beneficiation process
4/3/2014 The process adopted to upgrade the Fe content of iron ore is known as iron ore beneficiation (IOB). However, Iron ores from different sources have their own peculiar mineralogical characteristics and require the specific beneficiation and metallurgical treatment to get the best product out of it.
