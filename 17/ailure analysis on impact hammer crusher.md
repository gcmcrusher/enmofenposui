## Impact Crushers 
Impact crushers (also known as impactors or horizontal shaft impactors) can be used in primary, secondary, or tertiary applications. They use inertia of the blowbars fitted to the rotor to fracture the material, resulting in a high reduction ratio. Impactors are often used as a cost effective alternative to jaw and cone combination plants as
