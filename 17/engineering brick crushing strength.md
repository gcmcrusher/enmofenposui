## Strength of Brick Masonry 
The strength of a single brick masonry unit varies widely, depending on its ingredients and manu- facturing method. Brick can have an ultimate compressive strength as low as 1,600 psi. On the other hand, some well-burned brick has compressive strength exceeding 15,000 psi. Because portland-cement-lime mortar is normally stronger than the brick
