## Gold and Silver Minerals in Sulfide Ore 
Nov 10, 2020Abstract—Gold and silver are capable of forming stable natural compounds with different elements. For gold 36 minerals are known: 10 in the class "Native metals, intermetallic compounds" and 26 in the class "Sulfides (selenides, tellurides, arsenides, antimonides, bismuthides)." For silver, 194 minerals are registered in the MMA, presented in 8 classes.

## Gold Extraction Recovery Processes 
Feb 29, 2016The practice of gold minerals beneficiation is optimized by using the information obtained from applied mineralogy. In this way, at the moment of development and select a process for treatment a gold ore, try to identify the gold minerals is the first step. Obviously, the detection of non-valuable minerals is important.

Finding the metal was only part of the process. After the discovery was made the next step was to bring the ore out of the ground. In the dry Mojave, hard rock miners dug and blasted, sinking shafts and tunnelings into the mountainside. Next, the ore would have to be crushed into a workable size before the metal could be extracted.
