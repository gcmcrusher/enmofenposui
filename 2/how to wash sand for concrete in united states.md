Specific Weight or Unit weight of Sand. Unit weight or Specific Weight of sand is calculated by the product of the density of sand and the standard gravity of sand. According to the US customary measurement system, dry weighs 1.631 gram per cubic centimeter, this density is equal to 101.8 pounds per cubic foot [lb/ft].

## Sand Extraction: 1. Introduction 
Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.
