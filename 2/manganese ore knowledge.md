## Manganese: history and industry development
China's demand for manganese ore has been growing year by year because of the rapid development of the iron and steel industry. However, manganese resources in China are very low grade and domestic supply can't satisfy demand, thus China's imports of manganese ore have been increasing year by year. In 2010, imported manganese ore accounted for 55% of
