20.03.2018In a dual-stage hammer mill, there are really three phases of size reduction, due to what is known as the attrition zone. The attrition zone is the area created between the top rotor and bottom rotor of a dual stage hammer mill. Materials pass through the initial mill and screen arrangement and are then directed toward the secondary mill chamber.

## Beware the Attrition Mill – Chicago Boyz
03.07.2011Beware the Attrition Mill. July 3, 2011 by David Foster. There is a type of machine called an attrition mill. It consists of two steel discs which rotate at high speed in opposite directions, crushing the grain or other substance being milled between them.

## Jet mill working principle 
Jet mills operate in compressed air, gas or high pressure superheated steam. Jet mills have no moving parts, thereby eliminating contamination due to contact with external grinding media. It is also an ideal process to grind heat-sensitive and waxy material because no attritional heat is generated. Jet mill works on fluid energy.
