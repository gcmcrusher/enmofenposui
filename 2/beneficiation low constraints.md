The invention provides a beneficiation method of low-grade ilmenite. The beneficiation method includes the following steps: screening and grading raw ore to obtain coarse grain materials and fine grain materials, subjecting the coarse grain materials and fine grain materials to first-stage iron removal respectively to obtain coarse grain iron tailings, fine grain iron tailings and inferior

## Existing and New Processes for Beneficiation of Indian Iron ores
The iron ore industries of India are expected to bring new technologies to cater to the need of the tremendous increase in demand for quality ores for steel making. With the high-grade ores depleting very fast, the focus is on the beneficiation of low-grade resources. However, most of these ores do not respond well to the conventional beneficiation

When the ore is extracted from the mines it is not excavated in the purest form which can be processed. There will be resulting gangue minerals (Mn at 3%) along with the ore concentrate which needs to be refined. This process generates two by-products, which include high grade ore and waste streams. The beneficiation can be done either

## Analysis of the key factors affecting beneficiation in South Africa
South Africa has the wealthiest mining jurisdiction in the world with mineral resources valued at $2.5 trillion. Despite these assets, the level of value added mineral beneficiation undertaken in South Africa is low, with activities in the mining industry dominated by primary production and exports of raw or partially processed minerals.
