Coal is transported by sea through ship from Haldia, Paradeep, Vizag Port to TTPS. Coal transported by ship is given to crushers which crush the coal particles to 10-20mm in diameter. The crushed coal is fed to coal grinding mills with bowl roller via coal bunkers. The powdered coal is given to pulverisers and to furnace through forced draft fans.
