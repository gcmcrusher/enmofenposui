## Explosion protection for coal grinding plants. What should 
Most explosions in coal mill plants have their initial ignition location within the mill chamber. This is because the mill chamber is the section of the plant in which the conditions for the ignition of air dispersed fuel are most favourable, as well as the risk that tramp metal gets trapped in the grinding media. Also, grinding causes impact

Coal is transported by sea through ship from Haldia, Paradeep, Vizag Port to TTPS. Coal transported by ship is given to crushers which crush the coal particles to 10-20mm in diameter. The crushed coal is fed to coal grinding mills with bowl roller via coal bunkers. The powdered coal is given to pulverisers and to furnace through forced draft fans.
