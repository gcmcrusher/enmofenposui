Borehole coupling is critical to good fragmentation of rock. The borehole should never exceed the diam-eter of the explosive by more than one-half inch. The air gap around an explosive charge absorbs the shock energy and results in poor fragmentation. The explosive column illustrated in Figure 8-6 on the right will produce the best fragmentation.
