The mine is expected to produce more than 300,000 oz of gold during its initial six-year mine life. At Gedabek, ore is crushed, screened and agglomerated before stacking in conventional heaps. The pregnant leach solution (PLS) is fed to four adsorption columns in parallel containing 6.5 m3 per column of MINIX ion-exchange resin. Due to the fast

Gold processing - Gold processing - Mining and concentrating: The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied.

## Level measurement of ROM ore in the ore pass of a gold mine
The 100 m / 328 ft deep ore pass always keeps a certain level of run-of-mine (ROM) ore, which is collected and further transported to crushing and grinding plants. Rocks of different sizes are thrown into the ore pass by front-end loading trucks. For safety reasons, a screen grid (grizzly) is used at the dump point of the truck.

## Extracting Gold 
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.
