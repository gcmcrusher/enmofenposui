Coal grinding is one of the stages of the technological process for obtaining water-coal fuel. Water-coal fuel owes its emergence to water-coal slurry which was used in the 50â€“60s of the past century in order to find application for watered coal particles. At that time, the technology of water-coal slurry was considered to be rather a way to dispose coal industry waste.
