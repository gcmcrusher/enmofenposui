## What are recirculating linear bearings?
02.03.2017Linear ball and roller bearings can be broadly divided into two categories—recirculating and non-recirculating—depending on whether or not the rolling elements actually flow (or circulate) through the bearing housing. In order to understand what a recirculating linear bearing is, let's first take a look at bearings that don't recirculate.
