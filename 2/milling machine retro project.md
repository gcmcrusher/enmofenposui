Let's plug these numbers backwards and see what we get: 65 inches / 0.0001″ = 650,000 ten thousandths = 650,000 steps per minute. 650,000 steps per minute / 200 steps per revolution = 3250 rpm.

The cost for acquiring a new machine generally results in triple the cost of a retrofit, and the results are identical. In addition, retrofitting also avoids the "additional costs" associated with switching machines, such as those for tools, foundations, changes to work processes, staff training sessions and time lost due to familiarisation.
