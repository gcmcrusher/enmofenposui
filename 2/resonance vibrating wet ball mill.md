05.07.2020Vibration mills are similar to ball mills in that particles of the materials are crushed between porcelain or metal balls and the mill body. Drugs and excipients are readily ground to less than 5 mm, the grinding time being considerably less than is required in normal ball milling. As a result, the efficiency of the comminution process in vibratory milling is a good deal than it
