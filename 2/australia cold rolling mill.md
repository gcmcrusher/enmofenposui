## Cold rolling mill thickness control using the cascade
The improvements in thickness accuracy of a steel strip produced by a tandem cold-roIling mill are of substantial interest to the steel industry. In this paper, we designed a direct model-reference adaptive control (MRAC) scheme that exploits the natural level of excitation existing in the closed-loop with a dynamically constructed cascade-correlation neural network (CCNN) as

## Mill scale 
Mill scale, often shortened to just scale, is the flaky surface of hot rolled steel, consisting of the mixed iron oxides iron(II) oxide (FeO), iron(III) oxide (Fe 2 O 3), and iron(II,III) oxide (Fe 3 O 4, magnetite).. Mill scale is formed on the outer surfaces of plates, sheets or profiles when they are being produced by rolling red hot iron or steel billets in rolling mills.
