## Ball mill 
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, flint pebbles, and stainless steel balls. An internal cascading effect reduces the material to a fine powder. Industrial ball mills can operate continuously, fed at one end and discharged at the other end. Large to medium-sized ball mills are mechanically

## How Ball Mills Lifter Bar Affects Charge Motion
08.08.2018The cascading motion of ball charge forms a compressive zone inside the mill where particles may break under slow compression. The cataracting motion, on the other hand, causes the particles to break under high-impact forces. It has been shown that cataracting motion alone is not sufficient for effective grinding. Furthermore, balls that cataract may lead to
