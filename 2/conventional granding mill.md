## Raymond Fine Grinding Roller Mill 
With the conventional roller mill design, when fine grinding, the classifier tails (rejected particles) are also quite fine and can be easily entrained into the airstream. However, the fine grinding roller mills is designed with a separate path for the coarse reject material to travel back to the grinding zone in such a way that particle short circuiting is avoided.
