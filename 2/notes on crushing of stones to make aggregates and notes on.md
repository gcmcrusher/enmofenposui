## Introduction about fine aggregate and course aggregate
• Fine aggregates comprise of natural sand and stone which are graded into Zone 1 to Zone 4 depending on its ability to move through the 600-micron. The zones become gradually finer from Zone-1 to Zone-4. As per zones, 90% to 100% of the fine aggregate moves through 4.75 mm IS sieve and 0 to 15% moves through 150 microns IS sieve.

This is because the fraction that passes through 2.83mm sieve is actually the crushed material that otherwise was a part of aggregate particle/s. More is the fraction finer than this sieve; less tough the material is.

Table 1.1.10.1shows the crushing strength of various stones. Due to non-uniformity of the material, usually a factor of safety of 10 is used to find the permissible stress in a stone. Hence even laterite can be used safely for a single storey building, because in such . structures expected load can hardly give a stress of 0.15 N/mm 2. However in stone masonry buildings care

## Aggregates for Concrete
aggregate and crushed stone coarse and fine aggregate are produced by crushing natural stone. Crushing, screening, and washing may be used to process aggregates from either sand and gravel deposits or stone quarries. Aggregates may be produced from igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic rocks, but geological type does not by itself make an aggregate

In concrete making, aggregates generally contain pores both permeable and impermeable hence the term specific gravity has to be defined carefully. Actually there are several types of specific gravity. In concrete technology specific gravity is used for the calculation of quantities of ingredients. Usually the specific gravity of most aggregates varies between 2.6 and 2.8.

Answer (1 of 8): Of course. Quite a standard procedure. We call it crusher dust, or manufactured sand. Dependent on the source rock and type of crusher, the particle shape is unlikely to be nice round grains, which makes for concrete that is not quite as nice to play with, but it is still far fr
