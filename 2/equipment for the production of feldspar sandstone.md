## Feldspar 
Feldspar is the name given to a group of naturally occurring alumino-silicate minerals containing varying amounts of potassium, sodium, calcium, and/or lithium. The feldspar group of minerals is by far the most abundant group of minerals in the Earth's crust, making up about 50% of all rocks. Feldspar minerals are essential components in

## Sandstone 
Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized (0.0625 to 2 mm) silicate grains. Sandstones comprise about 20–25% of all sedimentary rocks.. Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar (both silicates) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth's surface. Like uncemented sand, sandstone may be any

Sandstone ( sometimes known as arenite ) is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized minerals or rock grains. Most sandstone is composed of quartz and/or feldspar because these are the most common minerals in the Earth's crust. Like sand, sandstone may be any color, but the most common colors are tan, brown, yellow, red, gray and white.

## Feldspar 
Feldspar is the most abundant mineral group in the Earth's crust. There are more feldspars (60%) than all the other minerals combined in the outer (13-17) km of the crust 1. Feldspars occur in most igneous and metamorphic rocks. They are less common in sedimentary rocks as they tend to break down to clay minerals in the weathering environment.

Quartz arenite or orthoquartzite are the terms for pure quartz sandstones which contain less than 5% feldspar or rock fragments. Sandstones with moderate feldspar contents (5–25%) are called subarkoses.When granitic rocks and other coarse- to medium-grained rocks are broken down by weathering or erosion, they form sand grains consisting for the most part
