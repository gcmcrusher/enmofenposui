Please understand though that most parts are heavy it makes no sense to cram too much stuff into a certain sized package, the parts will arrive damaged. If you're purchasing one of the larger items, for instance a grinder chassis, as well as some of the smaller items, we can ship some of the smaller items in the same box as the chassis: the weight goes up so Fedex charges more

07.12.2020I'd love to see a video and review of the KMG-TX. I've never had a single problem my KMG grinder. It is built like a tank and will last forever. It did seem that Beaumont Metal Works stopped innovating and didn't care to increase production to support demand for attachments and specialty wheels about 5+ years ago.
