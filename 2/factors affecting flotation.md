05.01.2021The separation of copper and arsenic has always been a major problem of the flotation beneficiation process, which is affected by the multiple factors: the chemical speciation and mineralogical structure of elements in slag as well as the processing conditions such as pH of the pulp, the concentration of agents and the number of additives, etc. (Ma et al., 2016; Alter,

14.07.2022Grinding particle size. During the flotation process, the flotation effect of too coarse ore particles (greater than 0.1mm) and extremely fine ore particles (less than 0.006mm) is not good, and the recovery rate is low. 1. In the coarse flotation, due to the large weight, the shedding force of the ore particles increases.

## What are the factors that affect the flotation effect?
Answer: The factors affecting the flotation effect mainly include the following three aspects: 1. It is related to the particle size of the mineral: it has been proved by practice that when the particle size of the mineral is suitable, the effect is good, too coarse or too fine, which is unfavorable to the flotation effect.
