## Surface Roughness Chart: Understanding Surface Finishes
Surface finish refers to the process of altering a metal's surface that involves removing, adding, or reshaping. It is a measure of the complete texture of a product's surface that is defined by three characteristics of surface roughness, waviness, and lay. The surface roughness is the measure of the total spaced irregularities on the surface.
