## What Raw Materials Are Used in Glass Making? 
13.04.2020By Staff Writer Last Updated April 13, 2020. There are four main raw materials used to make glass: silica sand, soda ash, dolomite and limestone. In many cases, broken pieces of glass called cullet are also added to these raw materials to help them properly melt when heated. There are a number of different ways to make glass, depending on the

## The making of glass fiber 
01.06.2020The glass fiber process. Textile-grade glass fibers are made from silica (SiO 2) sand, which melts at 1720C/3128F.SiO 2 is also the basic element in quartz, a naturally occurring rock. Quartz, however, is crystalline (rigid, highly ordered atomic structure) and is 99% or more SiO 2.If SiO 2 is heated above 1200C/2192F then cooled ambiently, it crystallizes
