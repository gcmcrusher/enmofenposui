## Alluvial Tin Ore Washing Plant for Tin Ore Process
The flow sheet of alluvial tin ore is usually very easy with simple screening and gravity separation involved to get high grade tin concentrate. For alluvial tin of low single separation degree, ore milling and further gravity separation will be needed after screening and gravity separation to guarantee the concentrate grade and recovery of the whole tin beneficiation processing line.

Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-coloured metal. Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called tin cry can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.
