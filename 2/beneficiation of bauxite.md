## Bauxite 
Bauxite production has increased from 144 Mt worldwide in 2002 to 178 Mt in 2006. Most of this is mined from open cast mines in Australia (62 Mt), Brazil and China (both 20 Mt) followed by Guinea (15 Mt), Jamaica (15 Mt), and India (13 Mt). In 2006, Alcoa, Chinalco, Alcan, Rusal and BHP Biliton accounted for or controlled almost 60% of the 69 Mt of worldwide alumina

Each type of bauxite ore presents its own challenges in terms of mineral processing and beneficiation for the generation of alumina [7,8]. Normally, the beneficiation or treatment of bauxite is limited to crushing, sieving, washing, and drying of the crude ore [3]. Flotation has been employed for the upgrading of certain low-grade bauxite ores,
