## Mechanical and durability properties of portland limestone cement 
Incorporation of 1% nano CaCO 3 into PLC concrete provided the optimal performance, where the 56 days compressive strength was increased by approximately 7%, and the permeability was reduced by approximately 13% as compared to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete. Further, improvements were observed in other durability aspects such as Alkali-Silica Reaction

Ohorongo CEM II A-LL 42.5N Portland Limestone Cement is designed to meet a strength class 42.5 with a normal early strength "N". The "LL" indicates limestone of high quality and "A" represents 6%-20% of mass. Ohorongo CEM II A-LL 42.5N Portland Limestone Cement can be used in applications where a higher strength class is required.

Cement is a versatile chemical compound that has provided several options for construction in this modern age. Cement is manufactured by heating a mixture of limestone, laterite, clay and other materials, in a definite proportion, at 1450℃. At this temperature clinker is formed which on cooling is ground with gypsum to obtain OPC Cement

## Cement — Cementos Molins
The cement manufacturing process starts with extracting the limestone, which is then crushed, together with clays, to an impalpable size. Next, the raw powder is calcinated at 1,450C in a rotary kiln to form the clinker, a name associated with the sound the mixture makes inside the furnace. Finally, the clinker obtained is ground together with the plaster and additives that

## Performance Enhancer for Portland Limestone Cement (PLC)
It is well known that portland-limestone cement tends to high cohesive resistance, due to the attraction forces between the fine limestone particles. This can hinder the discharge of trucks or silos because solids can generate stagnant zones. Many empirical test methods such as the angle of repose, the comparison of bulk density or the packset method7 have been developed

## What Can Limestone Do For You? 
16.02.2022Limestone use in cement is not new. ASTM C150, "Standard Specification for Portland Cement," allows up to 5% by mass limestone in typical Type I cement. Therefore, switching from ASTM C150 Type I cement to ASTM C595. Type IL cement could result in a limestone content increase of less than 1% in a given concrete mix design.
