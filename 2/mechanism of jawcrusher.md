To reduce its inertial force, we must try our best to reduce its weight. So its lower the cross section is made of the shapes of a cross or box. There are two types for the connecting rod: whole structure and composite structure. The former is suitable for medium and small jaw crusher. And the latter is suitable for the large size jaw crusher.

## Jaw Crusher 
Rose and English [9] determined the capacity of a jaw crusher by considering the time taken and the distance travelled by the particles between the two plates after being subjected to repeat crushing forces between the jaws. Therefore, dry particles wedged between level A and level B (Figure 4.4) would leave the crusher at the next reverse movement of the jaw.
