Most ore deposits are named according to their location, or after a discoverer (e.g. the Kambalda nickel shoots are named after drillers), or after some whimsy, a historical figure, a prominent person, a city or town from which the owner came, something from mythology (such as the name of a god or goddess) or the code name of the resource company which found it (e.g. MKD-5

Laboratory Sampling Assaying Equipment. Ore-sampling is generally done in the laboratory by hand. If it is desirable to do mechanical sampling, only intermittent machines—those which take the whole of a stream of ore at stated intervals—are allowable. The small-size machines of Bridgman and Constant do good work.
