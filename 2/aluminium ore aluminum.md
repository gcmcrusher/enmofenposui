## Aluminum Statistics and Information 
Aluminum is the second most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust after silicon, yet it is a comparatively new industrial metal that has been produced in commercial quantities for just over 100 years. It weighs about one-third as much as steel or copper; is malleable, ductile, and easily machined and cast; and has excellent corrosion

A tale of two spellings. Both aluminum and aluminium have a long history of use referring to the metallic element (commonly used as foil to cover food). They both date to the early 19th century, stemming from the word alumina. Aluminum became preferred in the United States and Canada, while aluminium became favored throughout the rest of the

That means 3 seperate ore blocks per metal (gravel, sand and dust). I can't use the forge ore dictionary because there are Unifier items that allows you to turn one ore block into a different ore block. Which allows people to 'unify' ore dust back into ore gravel and auto-hammer it again and again generating giant piles of metals in what I consider a 'cheaty' way. So that means I

The most common aluminium ore is bauxite but obtaining the metal from it is far from a straightforward matter. The metal was first identified in the early nineteenth century and obtained the name 'aluminum' from Sir Humphry Davy. This was later modified to aluminium when elemental names were unified, although in the USA it was decided as recently as 1925 to

## Is it Aluminum or Aluminium? A Fascinating Spelling History
15.07.2022Alum is a sulfate salt of aluminum, but the existence of the metal was unknown at the time. In 1595, Andreas Libavius proposed Alumina as the name for the yet-unidentified soil that formed the base of Alum. Sir Humphry Davy, a Cornish chemist and inventor, performed three unsuccessful attempts to isolate this unique element through electrolysis.
