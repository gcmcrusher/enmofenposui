## Slate Facts 
School children used pieces of slate as a writing board to practice their math and writing during the 1800s. Slate can easily be broken into neat, thin sheet because of its foliation. The majority of mined slate is used for roofing because it does not absorb a lot of water and can withstand freezing air. Slate is very expensive to make and install.

Morning on the slate aggregate road, between slate wall and slate fence. Photo by Nancy Lord. A. t the pub next door to where I'm staying, I sit by the fire with Tim and Annie, regulars I've sometimes chatted with.. I mention that I took the Braichgoch mine tour and that I thought Mark did a good job of it, and that I'd just found a fabulous book about Welsh slate.
