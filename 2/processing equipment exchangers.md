## Thermal Equipment – Process Piping Designer
Like all horizontal cylindrical equipment, exchangers are always supported by two saddles. It is the Piping designers responsibility to decide which end is the fixed or anchored saddle and which is sliding. When exchangers are adjacent to a Pipe rack the anchored, fixed saddle is always closest to the rack and opposite end to the Channel end.
