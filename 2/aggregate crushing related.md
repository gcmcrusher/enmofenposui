## Aggregates 
Aggregates are composed of geological materials such as stone, sand, and gravel and are used in virtually all forms of construction. They can be used in their natural state or can be crushed into smaller pieces. The aggregates used for building are called "construction aggregates". Aggregates are also used in agriculture, manufacturing, and

## Crusher 
Crusher. For other uses, see Crusher (disambiguation). A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as

The displacement of the crushing plate is measured by a Hewlett-Packard3 7D-CDT1000 displacement transducer, a linear differential transformer that produces a d.c. voltage pro-portional to the displacement of its core. Since the crushing energy is the integral of the product of the force on the sample and the displacement of the crushing
