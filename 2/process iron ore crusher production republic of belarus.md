## Magnet Manufacturing Process 
Magnet Manufacturing Process. There are several processes for making magnets, but the most common method is called Powder Metallurgy. In this process, a suitable composition is pulverized into fine powder, compacted and heated to cause densification via "liquid phase sintering". Therefore, these magnets are most often called sintered magnets.

## Raw Material Mining and Quality Control for Steel Manufacturing
Steel is an alloy consisting mostly of iron and less than 2% carbon. Iron ore is, therefore, essential for the production of steel, which in turn is essential in maintaining a strong industrial base. 98% of mined iron ore is used to make steel. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. The majority of iron ore is mined in Brazil, Australia
