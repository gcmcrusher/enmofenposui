Flotation of sulphide minerals from their ores is achieved by a process in which two or more conditioning steps are carried out prior to a froth flotation step. The first step comprises conditioning a pulp of the ore in the presence of at least one alkaline agent selected from a group of agents which is defined in the specification which follows.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores
Sulfide ores are generally processed using pyrometallurgy, the extraction and purification of metals by processes involving the application of heat. This process uses a series of physical steps and high temperatures to extract and purify copper from copper sulfide ores, in four basic steps: 1) froth flotation, 2) thickening, 3) smelting, and 4
