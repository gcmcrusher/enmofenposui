Aragonite and vaterite are polymorphs (latin for many shapes) with calcite, meaning they all have the same chemistry, but different crystal structures and symmetries. Dolomite, also known as dolostone and dolomite rock, is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2.

## The unusual mineral vaterite in shells of the freshwater bivalve 
Vaterite is seldom found in the natural environment because it is less stable than the other calcium carbonate polymorphs (aragonite and calcite). In the few reported cases of vaterite formation in molluscs, it is usually related to unusual biomineralisation events such as shell regeneration, pearls and initial stages of shell formation.

## A rare mineral, vaterite, acts as a shock absorber in the eggshell 
Birds' eggshells are primarily composed of calcite, an abundant polymorph of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).However, the eggshells of some species are coated with spherules of vaterite, a rare and thermodynamically unstable polymorph of CaCO 3, the function of which remains unknown.We experimentally tested the mechanical and physiological effects of the vaterite

Jun 22, 2010Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) with abnormally thickened shell valves were found in four rivers in the UK (Rivers Yare, Waveney, Thames and New Bedford River). The material making up these malformations was the rare calcium carbonate polymorph vaterite. Vaterite is seldom found in the natural environment because it is less stable than the other
