## Pneumatic Conveying 
What is Pneumatic Conveying? Pneumatic Conveying is a cost- and energy-efficient method of transporting dry bulk materials such as powders and granules from one place to another.. A typical example of a pneumatic conveying system that we engineer and manufacture involves conveying a material (such as polymer, lime, soda ash, plastic pellets/powder, dry milk etc.)

## Pneumatic Conveying Systems 
Pneumatic transportation can be built as a pressure or vacuum system. The most commonly applied pneumatic conveying mode is dilute phase conveying where particles are airborne. Depending on the size, shape and weight of the particles, the gas velocity will range from 4 to 40 m/s [4,000 to 8,000 ft/min].
