## Shaft Retention Components Information 
Single split shaft collars are used as mechanical stops, bearing retainers, or shaft protectors on round shafts, bars, and tubes. Similar to the double split shaft collar, the machine screw is tightened to close the clamp around the shaft. Installs easily and infinitely adjustable. Provides more holding power compared to set screw shaft collars.

A double bearing assembly is for supporting a rotatable shaft within a housing and includes two axially-spaced inner races mounted on the shaft. Each inner race has an outer race surface with a radially-outwardly extending shoulder section adjacent one axial end and are arranged such that the two shoulder surfaces are facing.

## Shaft Bearings 
15.04.2014April 15, 2014. By definition, a shaft bearing (sometimes called a Cutless bearing) is a rubber-lined composite or brass bearing through which the propeller shaft turns, and as such, is the final component in the drivetrain forward of the prop. The cylindrical bearing generally has a grooved inner surface so water can flow through for lubrication.

Determining proper shaft and housing fits is critical to ensure long bearing life. The fit, or amount of interference that exists between mating components (such as the shaft and bearing bore), can be devised into three categories: loose (slip), transition, and press (tight).

## How to Determine Bearing Shaft and Housing Fit 
By reviewing the table in our Axis ball bearing Catalog, note that the appropriate fits are a k5 shaft fit of .7875"-.7878" and a J7 housing fit of 1.850"-1.851".Of course, this is only one example. For your application, you'll need to have a general idea about what the fits should be beforehand.
