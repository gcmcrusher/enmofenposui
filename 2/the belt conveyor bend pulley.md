## What effect does the pulley diameter have on the belt?
The diameter of the pulley has an important influence on the life of the belt. The catalog value of the smallest pulley diameter must be taken into account. The recommended diameter generally increases the number of belt bends, thereby accelerating belt fatigue and shortening belt life. Our smallest pulley diameter indication is based on the neutral layer of the area, at an

## The cladding of a conveyor pulley 
The pulleys of a conveyor system are clad for a number of reasons: Grip. Wear. Efficient use. The main reason is grip. A belt clad in rubber or a combination of rubber and ceramics has, compared to the rubber conveyor belt, a higher friction and therefore a better grip. The slippage of the belt is thus minimised. Another important reason is wear.
