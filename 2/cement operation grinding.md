## The How, What, and Why of Grinding SCMs 
The grinding operation is critical in order to achieve the necessary particle size distribution for the successful use of SCMs. Some materials can be ground together with the rest of your cement mix (so-called 'intergrinding), while others may benefit from a separate grinding operation. Likewise, water demand (to increase workability) can
