## Vibration Testing Applications 
Vibration Testing Applications. July 18, 2018. A founding physics principle states that every object vibrates to some degree. That can be at the micro level, where atomic and sub-atomic particles vibrate at slow or fast rates. Vibrations also happen at the macro level, where huge objects experience environmental forces causing them to move.

## Vibration 
Vibration is a mechanical phenomenon whereby oscillations occur about an equilibrium point.The word comes from Latin vibrationem (shaking, brandishing). The oscillations may be periodic, such as the motion of a pendulum—or random, such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road.. Vibration can be desirable: for example, the motion of a tuning fork, the reed in a woodwind
