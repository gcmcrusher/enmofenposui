Linear thermal expansion applies mostly to solids. Knowing the initial length L 0 [m] of a given solid (e.g. metal rod), the temperature difference ΔT [C] and the coefficient of linear expansion of the solid α [1/C], the change in length ΔT [m] of the solid can be calculated as: [Delta L = alpha cdot L_0 cdot Delta T tag{1}] The change in length is directly proportional with the

## Basics of Ball Valves 
Basics of Ball Valves. A ball valve is a form of quarter-turn valve which uses a hollow, perforated and pivoting ball (called a "floating ball") to control flow through it. It is open when the ball's hole is in line with the flow and closed when it is pivoted 90-degrees by the valve handle. The handle lies flat in alignment with the flow
