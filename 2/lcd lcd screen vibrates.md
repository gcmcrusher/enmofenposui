Jan 28, 2015 The screen on my Kindle Fire vibrates, rolls, shakes, flips to the point I cannot touch any stable place on the screen. The problem is that when I type, there's a slight vibration that transfers to the bigger LCD screen, making the screen shake a bit. It's not a huge deal, but it is bothering me.

## LCD screens don't flicker 
Contrary to popular belief, LCD panels do exhibit flicker, write Intersil's applications engineers.

You can right-click the Start button in the lower-left corner of your screen and then select Task Manager. If Task Manager doesn't flicker, an app is probably causing the problem.

## laptop display screen vibrates
There is nothing on the screen or inside it that will make it vibrate. The laptop screen only contains the circuit board, the LCD device for displaying the images, and wirings. It doesn't have a cooling fan that will cause the vibration. I suspect the vibration on your laptop doesn't come from the display rather from the body. Get Price
