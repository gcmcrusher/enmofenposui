## Hydraulic mining 
Hydraulic mining is a form of mining that uses high-pressure jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment. The facility processes nearly two million tons of tailings each month at a processing cost of below US$3.00/t (2013). Gold is recovered at a rate of only 0.20 g/t, but the low yield is compensated for by the extremely low cost of processing, with no risky or

Achten P statistic shows that the cost of a hydraulic transmission component which is to 40–80 pounds/kg, is more than three times that of a mechanical transmission component . Low energy efficiency is also a key factor limiting the

## Open Pit Mining 
17.02.2021Open pit mining has higher productivity (3–5 times of underground methods), lower production costs, more safe and hygienic working conditions, more complete recovery of a mineral, and lower per unit production cost. Open pit mining is characterized not only by its high share of total minerals production, but it is also considered as one of
