## Ball Mill Loading 
The starting point for ball mill media and liquid charging is generally as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical, irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 45% to 50% above the ball charge for total of 58%

M.H. Abd El-Salam, in Encyclopedia of Food Sciences and Nutrition (Second Edition), 2003 Corn Wet Milling. Corn wet milling is a process that gives starch as the main product output in addition to several other products, namely, oil, protein, and fiber. This process is a water-intensive technology as 1.5 m 3 of fresh water per ton of corn is needed in modern corn wet milling.
