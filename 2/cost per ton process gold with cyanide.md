Cyanide is a naturally occurring compound that bonds with gold, allowing it to be brought into solution. It can easily be separated from gold for collection. It is a simple, cost effective process. No suitable alternatives exist. In other words, banning the use of cyanide in effect bans the extraction and production of gold.

## The use of cyanide in gold mining
04.01.2015The mercury amalgamation process had previously been used but recovered only about 60 per cent of an ore body's gold. In contrast, leaching finely ground ore with cyanide can recover up to 97 per cent of the ore body's gold. The process involves: Removal of all topsoil from the area to be mined.

Since the 1890's, cyanide has been used to recover gold from gold bearing ores. And today, over 115 years later, most of the worlds gold is recovered with cyanide playing a large part in the

## Rcovery of gold in pyritic ores 
Using cyanide to recover gold from sulfide ores generally results in 30 to 35% recovery, and the best I have heard of is around 50% recovery. The fine coating of a iron compound definitely appears to be a key component of the inability of cyanide to efficiently leach low grade pyritic ores. Perhaps there is some room here for a pretreatment, to

XIX century, the process of cyanidation is the most important method used in the recovery of gold and silver from ores (Logsdon et al., 2001).

According to the ICMC, the amount of cyanide used in commercial gold operations is typically in the range of 0.01% and 0.05% cyanide (100 to 500 parts per million), and the code's website states that no accidental human deaths due to cyanide poisoning have been documented by the Australian and North American mining industries for over 100 years.
