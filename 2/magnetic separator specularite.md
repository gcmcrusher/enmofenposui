## Flotation separation of specularite from chlorite using propyl 
10.05.2020Separation of specularite from iron-containing silicate iron ore is challenging due to the similar surface properties of minerals and gangues. In this work, propyl gallate (PG) was applied as a chelating collector to separate specularite from chlorite. The flotation results indicated that collector sodium oleate (NaOL) shows little selectivity
