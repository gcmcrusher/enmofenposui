## Determine The Optimum Mix Ratio Of Compressed Concrete Using Quarry Dust
Effect of quarry rock dust on the flexural strength of. Jun 01, 2018Three replacement levels of 0%, 25% and 100% quarry dust were used in the concrete mixes. The 25% is the optimum replacement percentage achieved by carrying out strength studies for 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% sand replacement levels.

The lightweight aggregate is an aggregate that weighs less than the usual rock aggregate and the quarry dust is a rock particle used in the concrete for the experimentation. The significant intention of the proposed technique is to frame a mathematical modeling with the aid of the optimization techniques. The mathematical modeling is done by minimizing the cost and time

## AN INVESTIGATION ON EFFECT OF QUARRY DUST AS SAND
In this experimental study, the effect of quarry dust in lightweight foam concrete in terms of compressive strength and flexural strength had been focused. There were 36 numbers of cubes with dimension of 150 x 150 x 150 mm and 12 numbers of beams with dimension of 100 x 100 x 500 mm being considered.
