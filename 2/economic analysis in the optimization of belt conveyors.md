cost analysis was conducted by comparing the capital, replacement and operational costs of the two haulage systems for a Bauxite mine. In contrast, though operational flexibility is limited with the semi-mobile IPCC system, it reduces the life-of-mine haulage cost by about 60%, which has significant effect on the economic aspect and environmental footprint of the operation. 1.
