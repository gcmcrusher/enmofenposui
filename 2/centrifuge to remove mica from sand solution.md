Make sure to test both media and pressure before you use it on your best specimen. If the pressure is too high, even soft media can damage much harder

## SMP 
The easy solution to removing sand and dirt is to install a LAKOS SandMaster Separator. These NSF certified residential separators remove sand and dirt continuously with no moving parts, cartridges to change, or screens to clean. An SMP equipped with an automated purge valve flushes sand out of the separator automatically; Zero maintenance!

11.10.2016Drilling fluid enters the removal-tank section after it passes through the main shale shaker. Immediately below the main shaker is the first pit, called a settling pit or sand trap. Fluid passing through the shaker screen flows directly into this small compartment. The fluid in this compartment is not agitated. This allows solids to settle. Continue reading SETTLING PITS

## Centrifuge 
Centrifuges. A centrifuge is usually used to remove small drilled solids (and small barite) from the active drilling fluid system. These solids significantly increase the plastic viscosity and decrease drilling performance. The heavy slurry (or underflow) from a centrifuge contains both barite and drilled solids.

Rather, a centrifuge consistently removes small abrasive wear particles down to 1/10 micron. When fit to a diesel engine, analysis shows that 98 percent of the particles collected in the centrifuge are 10 microns or less. This is significant because film thicknesses of critical wear areas in the engine are also small: 0 to 2 microns - rings, liners and turbochargers

## Can A Centrifuge Separate Salt From Water?
A centrifuge cannot separate salt from water. Centrifuges use the force of gravity to affect the separation of solids from liquids. Salt dissolves in water to form a solution. The centrifugal force exerted by a centrifuge separates immiscible phases such as sand from water but not miscible phases such as salt in water.
