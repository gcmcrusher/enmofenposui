## What is the Best Material to Reduce Vibration? 
04.02.2015Unlike pure viscous- or elastic-based materials, Sorbothane reduces vibrations over millions of cycles without degrading. Because it's a viscoelastic material, it absorbs, isolates, and reduces vibrations simultaneously. It is capable of absorbing nearly 95% of shock energy and reducing more than 50% of vibration energy.
