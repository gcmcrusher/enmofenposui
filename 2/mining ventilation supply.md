## HSE 
06.04.2015The Mines Regulation 2014 (MR14) came into force on 6 April 2015. MR14 is the result of a major review of health and safety mining legislation by HSE involving significant input from the mining sector. One of the key aims of the review has been to remove the unnecessary regulatory burden on business through clarification and simplification.

Fan types. Fans are mechanical units designed for air transportation in the ducts, direct air supply or air exhaust from the premises. Air is moved due to the pressure drop between the fan inlet and outlet vent. An axial fan has the form a cylindrical-cased wheel with the impeller fixed to a bushing at some angle to rotation plane.

## Underground Mine Ventilation A Case Study
In the view of mine ventilation, it is an important aspect of underground mining in which it is required to clear all harmful gases, as in coal mines removes fumes from blasting and occasional exhaust from diesel equipment and also at the same time it provides fresh air to the miner s which improves their efficiency. so, the careful study of mine ventilation is needed and it is

## Guidance about underground air quality and ventilation
The basis of effective ventilation of underground mines is the adequacy of the primary ventilation system. This is the total mine air volume flow generally through the major underground workings, normally involving splits into parallel circuits. Factors that determine the total primary volume capacity (and pressure) requirements include: extent

## The importance of underground mining ventilation 
Underground mining ventilation aims to control the environment by providing enough air to dilute and remove contaminants such as dust, diesel fumes, heat, and bad air. There are many types of ventilation fans used in mining depending on the size and scale of the operation, but all fans work to do the same thing – keep miners safe while they
