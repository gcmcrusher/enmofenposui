## Simulation of Ceramic Grinding Mechanism Based on Discrete Element 
The grinding mechanism is the base of developing new precision machining technology, especially for brittle materials including ceramics. In previous work, many results were gained from single grit cutting model in which a grit is in contact continuously with a workpiece, similar to the indentation or scratching process, to model the material remove in grinding processing.

## Grinding of alumina ceramic with microtextured brazed diamond 
To obtain a novel wheel for precision grinding of hard and brittle materials, a new approach for grain-arranged brazed diamond end grinding wheels with microtextures is proposed in this study. All these are the prerequisite for the formation of ironing in the process of grinding ceramics with brazed diamond end grinding wheels.

## 5 Grinding Considerations for Improving Surface Finish
If the goal is to improve the current surface finish from 20 microinch Ra to 17 microinch Ra, then simply increasing the wheel speed and/or reducing the feed rate slightly might be sufficient. However, if a finer surface finish is required, then these five factors should be addressed. 1. Grinding Operational Parameters.
