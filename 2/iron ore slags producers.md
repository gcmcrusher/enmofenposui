## Iron ore raw materials 
Rich iron ore contains more than 57 % iron, less than 8–10 % silica, less than 0.15 % sulphur and phosphorus. It is a product of natural enrichment of banded iron formations originated by leaching quartz and decomposition of silicates during long-term weathering or metamorphosis. Lean iron ores may contain 26 % iron min.

## Iron Ore 
Iron ore pellets are spheres of typically 8–18 mm (0.31–0.71 in) to be used as raw material for blast furnaces. They typically contain 67%-72% Fe and various additional material adjusting the chemical composition and the metallurgic properties of the pellets. Typically limestone, dolostone and olivine is added and Bentonite is used as binder.
