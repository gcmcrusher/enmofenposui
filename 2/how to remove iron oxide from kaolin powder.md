Aug 01, 2017Effect of hydrochloric acid concentration and temperature on removal of iron oxide at constant time is shown in Fig. 5a–c. The data indicate that the removal of iron oxide is insignificant at a lower reaction time at a given acid concentration and temperature. Thus, the reaction time is also one of the important factors to remove iron oxide.
