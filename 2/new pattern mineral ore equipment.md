## Geology, Prospecting and Exploration for Iron Ore Deposits
Prospecting involves searching an area for mineral deposits with the view to mine it at a profit. In other words to transform the mineral deposit into an ore deposit. A geologist prospecting an area is looking for surface exposure of minerals, by observing irregularities in colour, shape or rock composition.

Mining tools is a general phrase that refers to all the mining equipment and mining machines used to extract minerals from the earth. Mined minerals appear in almost every consumer product—from cars, to electronics, to jewelry and more. Minerals like uranium and coal are major energy sources that account for 50% of the US's energy supply.

Mining is a non-combat activity that allows players to excavate various minerals and ores that are used as resources in Cetus, Fortuna, or the Necralisk. It can be performed in the Plains of Eidolon, the Orb Vallis, and the Cambion Drift. Before players can begin mining, they must first acquire a Nosam Cutter from Old Man Suumbaat in Cetus for Ostron standing, or a Sunpoint

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining Extraction
Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels, called adits, to reach the ore. Underground mining is, however, relatively expensive and is
