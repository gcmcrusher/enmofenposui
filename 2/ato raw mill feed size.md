Fill each jar with the hot tomato puree, leaving about 1/2-inch headspace at the top of each jar. Set the lids on the jars and secure them with the rings. Lower the jars into the canning kettle and boil for 40 minutes. The jars should be covered by at least 1-inch of water. Remove the jars and let cool.

Grinding of Feedstuffs. Grinding is a major function of feed manufacturing and is by far the most common method of feed processing. It is also the most cheapest and simple process and results in a substantial reduction in particle size and exposure of much more surface area to action of chemicals as well as to the digestive juices.

• cement is ground much finer than raw meal • the feed to a cement mill is often completely dry and is significantly more difficult to grind than raw materials • requirements to the particle size distribution of the finished product are much more strict when grinding cement than when grinding raw materials . 3 These differences between cement grinding and grinding of raw materials

## Rawmill 
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into rawmix during the manufacture of cement. Feed size can be up to 100 mm. Roller mills are efficient, using about half the energy of a ball mill, and there seems to be no limit to the size available. Roller mills with output in excess of 800 tonnes per hour have been installed. Unlike ball mills, feed to the mill must be

## Ingredient density affects feed mill efficiency 
Efficiency will be lost if the load size has to be reduced or if drivers have to shovel feed to make it fit into the compartments. Conclusion. The take-home message is that the densities of ingredients and changes in diet formulations can dramatically affect storage capacity, batching and mixing times, pellet mill throughput and feed delivery.
