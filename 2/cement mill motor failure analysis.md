A Cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets, hardens and adheres to other materials, binding them together. Cement is seldom used solely, but is used to bind sand and gravel (aggregate) together. Cement is used with fine aggregates to produce mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel aggregates to produce concrete.
