Randell L. Mills (born September 3, 1957) is a American businessman known for his controversial hydrino theory. In the conventional theory of the hydrogen atom, the electron can release energy by dropping to a lower orbital. However, this process ends at the ground state, below which there are no stable solutions to the quantum-mechanical wave equation. Mills

## Machining Nickel and Nickel Alloys 
08.07.2019Machinability. Nickel alloys work harden rapidly, and the high pressures produced during machining cause a hardening effect that slows further machining and may also cause warping in small parts. Using cold-drawn stress-relieved material is preferable for machining. Hot-rolled is less desirable and annealed is least preferred for most applications.
