## What Is A Surface Grinder 
Surface grinding is an abrasive process. It involves securing the object to a device that will hold it in place (a chuck) before slowly moving the object's surface across a grinding wheel that's spinning really fast. This will generate a flat plane wherever the machine comes into contact with the object. It also gives the object an even finish.
