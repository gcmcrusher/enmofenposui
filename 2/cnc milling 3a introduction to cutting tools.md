CNC Milling: Introduction to cutting tools Cutting tools come in a range of sizes, materials, and geometry types. It is generally more efficient to use a combination of different toolpaths and tools to achieve a detailed model rather than assuming that a small tool with a smaller stepover is the only way.

## Milling, What is it and how does it work? 
Introduction to Milling. Milling is a Substractive machining process that uses many machine toolsets to efficiently precision-cut a variety of materials (such as metals, plastics, or wood) into a defined geometrical part. Milling machines rapidly produce end-use parts by adopting 3- or 5-axis processes. Metal parts offer greater finishing
