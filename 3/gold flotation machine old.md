## How to Test if Gold is Real? 
Let's explore how to tell if gold is real with makeup. You'll need liquid foundation makeup and powder. First, coat the back of your hand, or your forehead, with a thin layer of foundation and then your powder. Wait until the foundation thoroughly dries. Once the foundation dries, press the gold into your skin.

In flotation, a mixture of slurry (crushed ore and water) and frothing agents are added into a flotation machine. A tube releases air into the tank of the machine and an agitator creates air bubbles at the bottom of the tank. Minerals that are hydrophilic, such as gold, attach to the bubbles' surface and are brought up to the top of the tank.

12.01.2022In flotation, a mixture of slurry (crushed ore and water) and frothing agents are added into a flotation machine. A tube releases air into the tank of the machine and an agitator creates air bubbles at the bottom of the tank. Minerals that are hydrophilic, such as gold, attach to the bubbles' surface and are brought up to the top of the tank.

## Optimisation of gold recovery by selective gold flotation for copper 
It was found that free cyanide did not depress the flotation of liberated gold, but zinc cyanide with a CN/Zn ratio of 2 did. The depression of gold flotation by zinc cyanide was due to the preferential adsorption of Zn(CN) 2 on gold surface over either 3418A or amyl xanthate in the solution, rendering gold surface hydrophilic.
