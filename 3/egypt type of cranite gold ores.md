3. Lead-bearing Silver ores: These are silver ores containing 4 percent or more of lead. The silver comes mainly from the lead-silver ores of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, Utah (chiefly Park City and Tintic), Colorado (Leadville and Aspen). Most of the output is obtained by the de-silverization of lead bullion using molten zinc.

QUARRIES. To appreciate quarry and mining operations in Egypt, one must understand that without them, there would be no great Pyramids and there would be no grand temples.

Gold ores are classified "free-milling" and "refractory" based on their response to cyanide dissolution. Bioprocessing can be used to treat refractory gold-bearing sulfide ores as well as carbonaceous gold ores. It is essential to characterize different types of gold ores to understand the extent and nature of gold-entrapment in different associated mineral phases before an

The Arabian-Nubian Shield, located at the northern end of the East African Orogen, is an extensive Neoproterozoic collision zone of thrusts that forms a tectonic zone formed by rocks of the ophiolite association and volcanogenic-metasedimentary deposits.

16.10.2018The results of the study have diverse implications, Ackerson says. For instance, while "certain deposits that form gold, copper and molybdenum occur directly above granites — hence their location is already known — there is some debate about how these types of important ore deposits form," he says.

Porphyry (/ ˈ p ɔːr f ə r i / POR-fə-ree) is a textural term for an igneous rock consisting of coarse-grained crystals such as feldspar or quartz dispersed in a fine-grained silicate-rich, generally aphanitic matrix or groundmass.The larger crystals are called phenocrysts. In its non-geologic, traditional use, the term porphyry refers to the purple-red form of this stone, valued for its

## The Rock GRANITE (Igneous Intrusive Rock)
Granite is possibly the most common igneous rock type known to the general public. Granite, which is named for its granular or phaneritic texture, has crystals that tend to be easily seen, although they are generally small. It is a rock that has been used for centuries for many different purposes such as building material.

## Rcovery of gold in pyritic ores 
Using cyanide to recover gold from sulfide ores generally results in 30 to 35% recovery, and the best I have heard of is around 50% recovery. The fine coating of a iron compound definitely appears to be a key component of the inability of cyanide to efficiently leach low grade pyritic ores. Perhaps there is some room here for a pretreatment, to
