04 | Mining in Africa INTRODUCTION The future is bright for mining in Africa. Over 30% of the world's global mineral reserves are found in Africa, yet less than 5% of the total global mineral exploration and extraction budget is invested in the continent. The potential for a burgeoning mining industry across these two emerging regions is immense.
