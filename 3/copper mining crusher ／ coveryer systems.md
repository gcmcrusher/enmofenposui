over large areas, surface, or open-pit mining, is the predominant mining method for copper in the world. After mining, copper is produced by one of two process routes: pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical. Within the pyrometallurgical route, the mined ore is crushed and milled, followed by a concentration step using flotation.
