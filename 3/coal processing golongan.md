## Coal Deposits 
Since the 1880s, more than 300 coal deposits and occurrences have been discovered, so far. Based on origin, age, tectonic setting, coal characteristics, and coal-hosting formations, the deposits can be classified into 2 coal-bearing provinces, 12 basins, and 3 areas (Bat-Erdene 1992) (Fig. 14.2 ).

Coal Production. The scale and rate of coal developments hinge on the markets and transport infrastructure. A 2009 World Bank review of the potential mining developments suggested that coking coal export projects were most likely as a result of the Chinese market may require an additional 20 million tonnes of imports per year with Mongolia in a good position to dominate

## Mineral Beneficiation and Processing of Coal 
The modern-day coal processing plants can be categorized into four different circuits, depending upon the size of the coal particles to be treated: (a) coarse coal processing circuit treating particles coarser than 10 mm, (b) small coal circuit for washing particles in the size range of 1-10 mm, (c) fine coal circuit for cleaning particles in size range of 0.15–1 mm, and

26.12.2018The normal yield of coal tar during the coal carbonizing process is around 4 %. Coal tar has a specific gravity normally in the range of 1.12 to 1.20, but exceptionally it can go upto 1.25. It depends on the temperature of carbonization. The lower specific gravity tars are generally produced when low carbonization temperatures are used. Viscosity of tar affected

## Coal Production 
Coal production continues to grow globally due to the demand for low cost energy and iron and steel, as well as cement. Coal, based on the current extraction rates, will last about 115 years longer than conventional oil and gas reserves, with an estimated 1.1 trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. Ten countries are responsible for 90% of the total global coal production.
