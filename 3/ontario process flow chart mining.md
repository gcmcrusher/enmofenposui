## Oil Sands 101: Process Overview 
A typical oil sands deposit in Alberta contains on average about 10% bitumen, 5% water and 85% solids, mostly in the form of coarse silica sand. Oil sands also contain fine solids and clays, typically in the range of 10 to 30% by weight. Bitumen is a heavy complex hydrocarbon, contained within the oil sands deposit.

## How to Measure Airflow Velocity for Mining Applications
Rotating Vane Anemometer. A rotating vane anemometer measures airflow through mechanical velocity. Airflow passes over the propeller of the vane anemometer, causing rotational motion. The speed of rotation is then converted into a value for airflow speed. Vane anemometers can typically measure airflows in a range of 1 m/s to 15 m/s.
