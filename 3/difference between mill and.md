## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
Jul 20, 2022The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform. The wet ball milling can not only grind agglomerate into fine particles, but
