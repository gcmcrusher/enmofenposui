Process Technology for the Rounding of Graphite Due to its use as a material for anodes in lithium-ion-batteries, graphite is of great importance in the context of electromobility. In order to obtain the high purity required for battery applications, the finely-distributed, so-called flake graphite which occurs naturally in stone, must be processed in various steps.
