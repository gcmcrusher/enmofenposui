Mar 28, 2021The crushed coal is then transported to the store yard. Coal is transported to bowl mills by coal feeders. 3. Bowl Mill. The coal is pulverized in the bowl mill, where it is grounded to a powder form. The mill consists of a round metallic table on which coal particles fall. This table is rotated with the help of a motor.

## How Much Maintain The Cement Temperature At Mill Outlet
May 27, 2016 Hot air for drying coal can come from cooler exhaust (normal air) or preheater exhaust (low oxygen). The inlet temperature to the mill is con- trolled to maintain the outlet temperature as described above and dedusted in a cyclone. Tempering to about 370 C is effected by bleed- ing in cold air between cooler and cyclone.
