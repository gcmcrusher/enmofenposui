## Top 16 Mistakes People Make When Installing Concrete
Concrete installation is not nearly as straightforward as it seems. There is a wealth of preparation that occurs before a single drop of concrete is ever poured onto the site. Everything from the mix design, quantity of concrete to purchase, site preparation, tools, weather forecast, placement process, form removal and curing process need to be Continue reading Top 16 Mistakes

For machine operated rammers, the usual weight varies from 30kg to 10 tonnes (6 lbs to 22000 lbs). These hammers with 2- 3 tonnes (4400 to 6600 lbs)weights are allowed to free fall from a height of 1m to 2m (3ft to 7ft) on the soil for the compaction of rock fragments. Rammers are suitable for compacting cohesive soils as well as other soils.

## How Cement Is Made
Concrete is formed when portland cement creates a paste with water that binds with sand and rock to harden. Cement is manufactured through a closely controlled chemical combination of calcium, silicon, aluminum, iron and other ingredients. Common materials used to manufacture cement include limestone, shells, and chalk or marl combined with

## Bearing Capacity of Soil 
30.06.2020The bearing capacity of your soil will help you determine if you need a shallow foundation or deep foundation. Soil strength directly under the footing, where loads are concentrated, is crucial to foundation performance. You can get a pretty good idea of the soil bearing capacity in the trench bottom using a hand penetrometer.

## Sub
The sub-base is the main load-bearing layer of paving construction. A well-designed sub-base should evenly spread the load of traffic, whether pedestrian or vehicular, down to the sub-grade, also known as the formation level. Best practice usually stipulates a geotextile non-woven membrane (e.g. Terram 1000), which acts as a filtration
