Design. The design of a plain bearing depends on the type of motion the bearing must provide. The three types of motions possible are: Journal (friction, radial or rotary) bearing: This is the most common type of plain bearing; it is simply a shaft rotating in a hole. In locomotive and railroad car applications a journal bearing specifically referred to the plain bearing once

JOURNAL BEARINGS Based on his theoretical investigation of cylindrical journal bearings, Professor Osborne Reynolds showed that oil, because of its adhesion to thejournal and its resistance to flow (viscosity), is dragged by the rotation of the journal so as to form a wedge-shaped film between the journal and journal bearing (Fig. 4).

Journal bearings are meant to include sleeve, plain, shell and babbitt bearings. The term babbitt actually refers to the layers of softer metals (lead, tin and copper) which form the metal contact surface of the bearing shell. These softer metals overlay a stronger steel support shell and are needed to cushion the shell from the harder rotating shaft. Simple shell-type journal bearings

## What is a Babbitt Bearing?
Babbitt bearings are found on motors, fans, pumps, turbines generators and other industrial equipment. The bearings are designed to support the weight of the shaft, while providing a non-damaging surface for the high speed rotating shaft. In a Babbitted bearing, the lining of the bearing is bonded with Babbitt (a low melting-point, soft alloy).

## Validation Of Journal Bearings For Use In Wind Turbine Gearboxes
13.05.2015Experience shows that journal bearings make a very good alternative to the roller bearings so far used in windpower gearboxes. The area of application for journal bearings is very varied: for large, heavy-duty applications hydrodynamic journal bearings in particular are worth considering. In the past such applications have been mainly large industrial gear units

## Hydrodynamic Friction of Viscosity
06.09.2018A journal bearing machine (JBM) supplied by PCS Instruments, Acton, UK, is used to measure the hydrodynamic friction of a steadily loaded engine bearing, lubricated by some of the same VM blends characterised previously [ 1 ]. Friction is measured over a range of applied speeds, loads and oil supply temperatures.
