## landforms created by deposition and erosion 
Landforms from Wind Erosion and Deposition What are the effects of sandblasting? Coastal landforms can be formed either by erosion or by deposition. Longshore drift is a method of coastal transport. The movement of these particles is called erosion. For wind, bed load is made of sand-sized particles, many of which move by saltation ( Figure

## How Do Landforms From Magma Form And Become Exposed
Tectonic plate movement under the Earth can create landforms by pushing up mountains and hills. Erosion by water and wind can wear down land and create landforms like valleys and canyons. Both processes happen over a long period of time sometimes millions of years.

What Coastal Landforms Are Made By Erosion. Sand dunes are landforms that are created by the wind agent of erosion. The wind weathers, picks up, and deposits the rock and sand particles in places that have very little or no vegetation. These places where the sand that is deposited usually have very loose or unconsolidated sandy ground. Visual Glossary Of Glacial Features.

## What are the landforms formed by wind erosion? 
Abrasion Another process of erosion, called abrasion, occurs when particles such as sand rub against the surface of rocks or other materials. Because sand is often made of quartz, a hard mineral, wind abrasion can be an effective agent of erosion — windblown sand particles eventually wear away rocks.
