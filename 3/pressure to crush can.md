The force of the crushing object ruptures muscle cells. The direct pressure of the object on the limb causes muscle cells to become ischemic. The combination of mechanical force and ischemia can cause muscle death within an hour.

How does the crushing can experiment work? When the inverted can is placed in cold water, the steam condenses, leaving the can mostly empty, and thus with a very low pressure inside of it.The difference between the low pressure inside and the atmospheric pressure outside exerts an inward force on the walls of the can, causing it to implode.

When the can is quickly immersed in cold water, the opening which allowed the gas to release, is blocked. This causes the remaining water and air in the can to reduce to a few drops of water, in result losing a lot of pressure. This is when the outside air pressure becomes greater, crushing the can.

It depends on the car and how compressed "crushed" is, but a ball park answer follows. Pressure is force divide by an area (F/L^2).

To crush the car would require more pressure, so 100 to 500 psi would provide a range of crushed levels of a car.
