## The effect of the ball to reactant ratio on mechanochemical reaction 
The effect of the reactant powder mass on reaction times for the mechanochemical formation of a soft matter model system was studied by in situ PXRD. The syntheses were performed at a constant ball mass in a shaker mill with and without glassy SiO 2 as an inert additive. Reaction times decreased with the increase of the ball to reactant ratio (BRR).

## Ball mill 
Ball mill. A ball mill, a type of crusher, is a cylindrical device used to grind chemicals or mix compositions. Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium, ideally non sparking milling media like lead balls. An internal cascading effect reduces the material to a fine powder.
