## Make Sandpaper Belts 
21.03.2013Sandpaper is a very versatile material. Though sanding belts tend to be very cheap, for the truly committed do-it-yourselfer, low cost is never an excuse to buy something premade.

12.11.2021They look like long, large erasers. To use this cleaning stick to clean clogged sanding belts you simply need to turn on your belt sander and run the cleaning stick backward and forwards across the belt surface whilst it is in motion.

I cut the ends to a matching bevel, then grind the grit off one end with a silicon carbide dressing stick, and glue it to the back of the other end. Neither Super Glue nor Duco contact cement seem to hold for long, even when joined under pressure. Anyone else making their own belts?
