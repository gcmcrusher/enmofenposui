## Particle Size 
Particle size has a profound effect on many product properties, from the impact of flavorings on food to the behavior of concrete in buildings. Such a wide range of applications requires a wide range of analyzers. HORIBA analyzers cover a particle size range is from below 1 nanometer to 30 millimeters, at concentrations ranging from 1 ppm to 50 vol% with shape determination

After shredding, polyester slices are washed to remove residues, labels, and other contaminants. Once cleaned, the polyester slices are then prepared to reduce to smaller particles called flakes. Flake, usually produced by other size requirements, reduces a granulator. A granulator is significantly different than a shredder.
