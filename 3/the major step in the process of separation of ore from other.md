It takes multiple steps to extract the important element from the ore: First, the ore must be separated from unwanted rocks. Then, the minerals need to be separated out of the ore; Since most minerals are not pure metals, further separation methods are required. Most minerals are chemical compounds that contain metals and other elements.
