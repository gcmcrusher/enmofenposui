There is such a formula for the design size of the feed port of the jaw crusher: the size of the feed port = (1.1 ~ 1.25)  the maximum particle size of the raw material. Many production personnel do not understand it, and always take the measured inlet size as the maximum feeding size. Therefore, if the raw material exceeds the specified large
