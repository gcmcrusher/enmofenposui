## EFFECT OF MICRO
Pelletization tests were conducted using pulverized iron ore to record changes in pellet strength by changing the volume of micro-particles and ore types. The strength of pellets when completely dried can be explained by the volume of micro-particles in ore, and the greater the volume of micro-particles, the higher the strength of pellets.
