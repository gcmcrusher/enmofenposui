Ball milling practice in the ore dressing industry is largely empirical. Although many investigators have worked on various of its phases, the present operating methods are mostly a matter of cut-and-try, with the result that the industry is not guided by its underlying principles. Consequently, practice varies extensively with regard to nearly all conditions of operations.
