## Electrochemical Grinding(ECG)
Electrochemical Grinding (ECG) is a combination of electrochemical (Anodic) dissolution of a material, according to Faraday's Law, and light abrasive action. The metal is decomposed to some degree by the DC current flow between the conductive grinding wheel (Cathode) and the work piece (Anode) in the presence of an electrolyte solution.

Making the cut: An electrochemical process that shapes complex turbine parts is shopping for more jobs to take on. Early hand grinding and pedal-operated wheels gave way to mechanized

## Wear of cathode in abrasive electrochemical grinding of hardly 
Jun 10, 2004From the curves run issues that the greatest linear wear arises in mechanical grinding of sintered carbides (MG G20) within the initial period of work (after 3 min). This wear is over eight times greater than in electrochemical grinding (AECG G20) at the same parameters.Within the terminal period of measurements (after 21 min) this difference

## Electrochemical grinding 
Electrochemical grinding is a process that removes electrically conductive material by grinding with a negatively charged abrasive grinding wheel, an electrolyte fluid, and a positively charged workpiece. Materials removed from the workpiece stay in the electrolyte fluid. Electrochemical grinding is similar to electrochemical machining but uses a wheel instead of a tool shaped
