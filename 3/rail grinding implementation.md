Based on circumferential grinding, the RC01 is designed to permit high working speeds without the need to dismantle track components such as signaling equipment, making it the first rail maintenance machine with an 80 km/h work capability. Its implementation and eddy current scans are discussed. Availability:

## Noise and vibration 
Roughness of the rails can be controlled by maintenance grinding and can be further reduced by acoustic grinding. Acoustic grinding requires that the rails are ground or polished as soon as a certain reference noise level is exceeded (1-3 dB(A)). The potential of acoustic grinding will increase if all train wheels are smooth as well.

## The rail grinding is the worst addition ever. : crashbandicoot
Rail grinding is one of the few mechanics that actually works in this game. I kinda like them, but they really did put a lot of them in and eventually got a bit boring. You can't look at Crash 4 as an extension of the first 3 games. It has new mechanics and it tries new things. The point of rail grind sections is that they're a memory game - you have to be able to remember where the

This seems logical but I do not know how to implement with my current movement logic: OnTriggerEnter store current skateboard movement direction. change the skateboard object to be a child of the rail object. skateboard movement direction changes to move along the parent (rail) transform.
