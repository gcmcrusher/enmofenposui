27.10.2021(So now I pre-crack the dry wheat grain in a hand-crank 3-roller mill, before running it through the vitamix.)--If you are going to make the corn into dough, you could pre-soak the dry hominy kernals in water, to soften and hydrate them. I did that with wheat berries and it did not seem to further scratch the plastic.

## Which Grain Mill Should You Buy? 
On the other hand, if you plan to use your mill every week to make flour, then an electric mill is probably the best choice. Hand-cranked mills take as much as five minutes to grind one cup of flour and are somewhat difficult to use. Electric mills can crank out up to twenty-four cups of flour in less than thirty minutes.

Do any of you have a hand-crank mill you recommend which can both finely mill wheat berries into flour and coarsely crack barley for brewing? From reading online, it sounds like the Victorio Deluxe and Wondermill Junior are both well-liked options, but I figured I'd ask the homebrewers for any first-hand experience for what seems to be the less-common use case.
