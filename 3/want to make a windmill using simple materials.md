Wind is a powerful force of nature. And you can make it work for you! This 4‑H STEM Lab experiment introduces kids to mechanical engineering and wind power by showing them how wind can be converted into energy. In this activity, kids will build a simple windmill and use it to power a pulley system to lift a bucket. Grades: Pre-K – 2.

## Heat your House with a Mechanical Windmill 
A mechanical heat pump is simply a heat pump without the electric motor – instead, the wind rotor is directly connected to the compressor (s) of the heat pump. This involves one less energy conversion, which makes the combination at least 10% more energy efficient than an electric heat pump driven by a wind turbine.
