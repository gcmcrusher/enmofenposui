## Pakistan: A case for indigenous coal 
04.08.2022Pakistan's longstanding electricity woes ranging from acute power shortages leading to long-duration blackouts to unaffordable prices to poor distribution infrastructure to the massive accumulation of inter-corporate debt of Rs2.5 trillion in less than a decade have been exacerbated by the recent Covid-related global supply disruptions and escalation in prices.
