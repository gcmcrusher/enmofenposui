## open cast mining of coal 
Both deep-level and open cast mining are used in South Africa to exploit various ores. The overburden (i.e., the rock, soil, and ecosystems that lie above an ore body or coal seam) often takes the form of high-potential agricultural land, 2 concentrated according to the uneven rainfall distribution and which often overlaps with ore bodies.

## Coal mining 
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is

## Sources of air pollution due to coal mining and their impacts
Abstract. Indian coal consumption is about 5.5% of the world and the share of coal as energy went up to 66%. The increasing trend of opencast coal mining lead to release of dust and gaseous pollutants. The Indian reserve of coking coal is mainly located in Jharia coalfield and having reserves upto a depth of 1219m are 19339 Mt.
