The form known as petroleum coke, or pet coke, is derived from oil refinery coker units or other cracking processes. Coke is used in preparation of producer gas which is a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen (N2). Producer gas is produced by passing air over red-hot coke. Coke is also used to manufacture water gas. PETROLIUM COKE

## Coke_(fuel) 
Coke is a solid carbonaceous material derived from destructive distillation of low-ash, low-sulphur bituminous coal.. The volatile constituents of the coal—including water, coal-gas, and coal-tar—are driven off by baking in an airless oven at temperatures as high as 2,000 degrees Celsius. This fuses together the fixed carbon and residual ash. Most coke in modern facilities is
