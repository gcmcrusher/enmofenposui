Apr 18, 2012It is broken into small pieces at the screening plant to produce non-agglomerated iron ore products, including high-graded haematite and magnetite. The gravity separation system removes impurities from the ore to produce haematite as an end product. The final product is stockpiled and blended to a maximum size of 31.5mm lump and 6.3mm sinter fines.
