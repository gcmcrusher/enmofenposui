## How do Variable Speed Pulleys Work? 
25.09.2018The speed range of variable speed pulleys is nearly infinite, within standard ratio limits. Our pulleys are designed for belt sizes from 1/4 V to 5/8 V and horsepower ratings from 1/12 HP to 1.0 HP, they are engineered to offer an economical alternative for many applications that may not require the expense of AC/DC variable speed motors and controllers.

This means that you need to reduce the speed by a minimum factor of 10. So you will need a mill pulley that is 10 times the diameter of the pulley on the motor to get down to 172.5 RPMs assuming your motor runs 1725 RPMs. When using pulleys to drive the mill it may be preferable to widen one flat on your mill's drive shaft using a metal file.
