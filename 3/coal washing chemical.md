COAL CHEMICALS. Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock with a high amount of carbon and hydrocarbons. Coal is classified as a nonrenewable energy source because it takes millions of years to form. Coal contains the energy stored by plants that lived hundreds of millions of years ago in swampy forests. Layers of dirt and

## Chemical leaching of coal to remove ash, alkali and vanadium
Molten caustic leaching (MCL) of coal has been studied under a variety of conditions, many of which studies have been conducted using a large excess of liquid caustic (3:1 caustic/coal or higher) so that, with stirring, coal is suspended in it. This provides a uniform temperature throughout the mixture and is preferred for chemical research. Some development studies
