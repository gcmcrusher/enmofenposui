Yep-need 300 mining to MINE fel iron, but 275 JC to prospect. I don't even have mining on my JC (I have a druid with mining/herbs so no reason to really-get all my farming done at once :) Comment by Thottbot Zangarmarsh is by far the best place to get Fel Iron Ore (And quite a bit of Adamantite). It's VERY abundant there and it's incredibly fast.

## Lessons Learned on Estimate Classifications
Castle (1985) compares the capital cost estimate in a project's feasibility study with the actual cost incurred for 17 international ferrous metal, non‐ferrous metal, uranium, and coal mining projects initiated between 1965 and 1980. Of these, 12 experienced capital cost overruns, 10 by more than 15%. The average overrun was 35%.
