## How to improve jaw crusher performance and productivity
30.03.2020Apply the proper jaw die profile. There are many kinds of rocks, differing in crushability, abrasiveness, flakiness, etc. Choosing the best combination of fixed and movable jaw dies profiles will help to optimize production when crushing difficult material. A Rock of low crushability requires a closer nip angle to keep the capacity as designed.

For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80–85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 1.7 = 78 cm.

Jaw crushers are used as primary crushers, or the first step in the process of reducing rock. They crush primarily by using compression. The rock is dropped between two rigid pieces of metal, one of which then moves inwards towards the rock, and the rock is crushed because it has a lower breaking point than the opposing metal piece.
