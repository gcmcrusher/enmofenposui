## 5 Things I Learned When Grinding Concrete for the First Time
My recommendation when starting your first few grinding jobs is to take diamond selection very seriously. This means properly understanding bonds and segment styles, as well as testing the concrete hardness if you have the ability to. Also take into account if you are removing something on top of the concrete and what you plan to do with it
