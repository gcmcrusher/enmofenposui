## Difference Between Gypsum and Limestone
04.11.2011November 4, 2011 Posted by Dunee. The key difference between gypsum and limestone is that the calcium sulfate is the main constituent in gypsum whereas calcium carbonate is the main constituent of limestone.

## Limestone Rock Uses, Location Types 
26.07.2021What is Limestone? Limestone is a common, chemical sedimentary rock formed primarily from calcium carbonate. It is generally light-colored and can also include fossils of calcium carbonate

## Calcium (Ca) and water 
In a watery solution calcium is mainly present as Ca 2+ (aq), but it may also occur as CaOH + (aq) or Ca (OH) 2 (aq), or as CaSO 4 in seawater. Calcium is an important determinant of water harness, and it also functions as a pH stabilizer, because of its buffering qualities. Calcium also gives water a better taste.

## Limestone
16.04.2022The chemical formula of limestone is CaCO3 or Calcium carbonate. The process of formation of limestone can be biological and non-biological. The biological processes are carried out by the accumulation of corals and shells. There are numerous uses of limestone such as material building, production of cement/concrete, bases of roads, toothpaste

28.12.2020There are, however, two uses that I am confident about. Quicklime (calcium oxide) is used in the steel making process. You will find out a bit more about this in a later page in this section. Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) is used to neutralise acid soils. It is more expensive than using limestone, but is faster acting.

18.06.2019Limestone is a sedimentary rock abundant on earth, which is mainly composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) and many other minerals. Calcium hydroxide is also called hydrated lime, lime hydrate or slaked lime, whose chemical formula is Ca(OH)₂and it is the product of reaction between quicklime and water.

13.10.2016Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed principally of calcium carbonate (calcite) or the double carbonate of calcium and magnesium (dolomite). It is commonly composed of tiny fossils, shell fragments and other fossilized debris. These fossils are frequently visible to the unaided eye on close examination of the stone surface, however this is

## Limestone 
This is the most common source of calcium used in livestock feeding. It is almost pure calcium carbonate. Calcitic limestone contains 36-38% calcium and can safely be fed free choice (ad lib) mixed with salt. Dolomitic limestone contains at least 5 % magnesium carbonate and should not be used for poultry, but it is as good as calcitic limestone

The crystalline, porous structure of Dolomite also provides aeration to the soil, stimulating nitrogen production and absorption. This enrichment helps with both magnesium and potassium deficient plants, allowing them to flourish. Additionally this boost can last between 2-4 months, whereas regular Limestone would only last between 1-2 months.
