## Technology and work practices 
Mining almost always commenced directly on the mineralized exposures, following the ore underground to a depth that was determined by a number of factors. We can distinguish between mining carried out on sources of concentrated mineralization, such as quartz-sulphide veins, and those situations where the ore is dispersed through a particular

## Tailings 
These tailings contain large amounts of pyrite (FeS 2) and Iron(II) sulfide (FeS), which are rejected from the sought-after ores of copper and nickel, as well as coal. Although harmless underground, these minerals are reactive toward air in the presence of microorganisms, which if not properly managed lead to acid mine drainage.

At the underground development of the sulfide deposits by the systems with a consolidating stowing, the temperature of the ore mass and the mine atmosphere increases due to the heat released during the hydration reaction of the hardening mixtures.

## 4.3.2: Underground Mining Methods 
Underground methods are traditionally broken into three classes: unsupported, supported, and caving methods. These classes reflect the competency of the orebody and host rock more than anything else. If you excavate an underground opening in the ore or the rock, is the opening stable -- i.e., will it remain open for an extended period, or will

What is Sulfide Mining? Metallic sulfide mining (aka hard rock mining) is the practice of extracting metals such as nickel, gold and copper from a sulfide-rich ore body. Sulfides are a geologic byproduct of mining in this area, and by exposing sulfides to the air and water in our atmosphere, sulfuric acid can be created — threatening to
