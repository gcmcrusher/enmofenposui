A motorized pulley is a drum motor in which the body rotates around a stationary shaft. The rotating outer "drum" becomes thetraction surface which powers the conveyor belt. Electric power leads pass through the stationary shaft to motor terminals inside the pulley housing. Since the end shaft does not rotate, there is no need for slip rings to deliver electrical power to the motor
