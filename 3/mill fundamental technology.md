## Milling (machining) 
Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece.This may be done by varying direction on one or several axes, cutter head speed, and pressure. Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations.
