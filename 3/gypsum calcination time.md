## Gypsum manufacturing process pdf 
Gypsum (CaSO 4 2H 2 O) can be calcined and grinded to obtain β-type hemihydrate gypsum (2CaSO 4 H 2 O), that is, building gypsum, also known as cooked gypsum or plaster. The model gypsum can be obtained when the calcination temperature is 190 C, and its fineness and whiteness are higher than that of building gypsum.

30.04.2021Gypsum, also called calcium sulphate hydrate, is a mineral found in sedimentary rock. Gypsum is formed by the evaporation and replacement of waters containing sulphates and calcium. Grey or white in colour, this amazing mineral can be crushed into fine dust and heated until most of the moisture is eliminated. This process is called calcination.

01.01.2015Gypsum (calcium sulphate dihydrate) is a naturally occurring mineral used in dentistry to fabricate models ( Figure 12.1a ), casts and dies ( Figure 12.1b ). Calcination is the process of heating the gypsum to dehydrate it (partially or completely) to form calcium sulphate hemihydrate. Plaster and stone are products of the dehydration process.
