## Carbon Adsorption In Recovery Of Gold 
The gold adsorbs onto the surface of the carbon. The loaded carbon is periodically removed from the columns, and sent to the stripping circuit. The carbon is then generally subjected to a heated solution (200 deg to 250 deg F) of (1%) sodium hydroxide and (0.1%) cyanide and the gold is re-dissolved and removed from the carbon surface.

Block caving is a new alternative method of developing new mines or extending the operation of open pits. Block caving is an underground hard rock mining method that involves undermining an ore body, allowing it to progressively collapse under its own weight. It is the underground version of open pit mining.

## Dilution and ore recovery 
Ground Support – Support can be used to maintain ore and waste surfaces, limiting the amount of dilution. Self-supported openings are more selective and have lower dilutions than block caving with typical dilution ranges from 5% to 15%. Additional factors which influence dilution to a lesser extent are as follows:

## Environmental Impacts of Gold Mining 
Toxic Waste. Modern industrial gold mining destroys landscapes and creates huge amounts of toxic waste. Due to the use of dirty practices such as open pit mining and cyanide heap leaching, mining companies generate about 20 tons of toxic waste for every 0.333-ounce gold ring. The waste, usually a gray liquid sludge, is laden with deadly cyanide

Highlights We describe the specific problems associated with mixed sulphide–oxide lead and zinc ores. We discuss methods for solving problems of mixed sulphide–oxide lead and zinc ores. We give results of direct leaching of the Angouran mixed ores using sulphuric acid without oxidising agents. We show how factors interact and drive the process.

## Shaft Mining, Mining Techniques, Underground Mining, Mining 
Shaft Mining. Shaft mining is a form of underground mining where shafts are pushed vertically from top to bottom to excavate the ores and minerals. It is also called shaft sinking. It is best suited for concentrated minerals such as iron, coal, etc. which can be found at the depth of the earth's surface. It is found mostly all over the world.
