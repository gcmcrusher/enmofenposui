Bauxite is found primarily in tertiary deposits and is commonly associated with laterite rocks found on the plateaus and hill ranges of peninsular India, as well as along the country's coasts. India produced over 20 million metric tonnes of bauxite.

## Recycled Aluminum 
28.03. years ago, aluminum was more expensive than gold—not because of how rare it was, but how expensive it was, and still is, to extract. Production of primary aluminum is q uite demanding and costly. In its purest state, aluminum is extracted from a clay ore called bauxite. The bauxite ore is purified to yield a fine white powder, aluminum oxide.

## Bauxite 
Bauxite (Fig. 1.33) is formed by surface weathering of clay rocks around the tropical region and composer of aluminum oxide (Al(OH) 3).It contains 15%–25% aluminum and only ore used for commercial extraction for aluminum. The bauxite occurs as near-surface layers and usually mixed with clay minerals, iron oxide, and titanium dioxide.
