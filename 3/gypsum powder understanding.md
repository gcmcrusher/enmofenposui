## Using Salts for Brewing Water Adjustment 
Choose a salt to use to add the needed calcium. Let's use gypsum. From Table 16, gypsum adds 61.5 ppm of Ca per gram of gypsum added to 1 gallon of water. Divide the 145 ppm by 61.5 to determine the number of grams of gypsum needed per gallon to make the desired concentration. 145/61.5 = 2.4 grams.
