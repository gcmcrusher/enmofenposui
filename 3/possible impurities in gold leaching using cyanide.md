Leaching and recovery of gold from ore in cyanide . 1. Introduction. Currently, cyanide is the predominant lixiviant used to extract gold due to its strong complexation with gold and the technical simplicity of the leaching process (Avraamides, 1982, Habashi, 1987, Marsden and House, 2006).However, the use of cyanide can bring challenges in terms of

20.03.2019Gold cyanide leaching is inefficient with conventional cyanidation. Bismuth ions can improve the efficiency of gold cyanidation by intensifying gold dissolution. The electrochemical behavior, structure information, and surface product of gold anodic dissolution were studied during the intensification of bismuth ions on gold cyanide leaching. The

Gold was selectively recovered with the use of Minix, while effective recovery of gold, platinum, and palladium over the base metals, copper, and iron, was achieved with Amberlite PWA-5. Successful elution of these metal cyanides was possible from both Minix and Amberlite PWA-5, using a 2M potassium thiocyanate solution at ambient temperature

Before all-slime cyanidation gold extraction, gold ore needs to be pretreated, that is, crushing, screening, grinding and grading.Pretreatment can separate gold from gangue minerals as much as possible, so as to achieve monomer dissociation of concentrate. It is also a necessary condition for cyanide leaching.
