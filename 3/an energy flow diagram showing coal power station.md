## Electrical Symbols — Stations 
A power station is an industrial facility for the generation of electric power. Most power stations contain one or more generators, a rotating machine that converts mechanical power into electrical power. The relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor creates an electrical current. The energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely. Most power

## Sankey diagrams for energy balance 
Sankey diagrams are ideal for visually representing energy balances. This is because an energy balance represents the contribution and flow of various energy commodities (fuels, heat and electricity, i.e. energy carriers in a marketable form) into the different sectors of the economy (e.g. supply, transformation and consumption) in energy units.

The diagram shows various stages in the production of clean energy from coal. At first, the coal is missed in deep pits underground and then carried to the surface. After that it is carried to the power plant, via a conveyer belt, where it is burnt in a large furnace to which oxygen is added. From this, raw syngas is produced.

A power station is an industrial facility for the generation of electric power. Most power stations contain one or more generators, a rotating machine that converts mechanical power into electrical power. The relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor creates an electrical current. The energy source harnessed to turn the generator

Coalfired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced, under tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled, condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the . More + flow diagram of coal to electricity

## How Is Coal Converted to Usable Energy? 
04.04.2020Coal is converted into electricity through a complex process that involves steaming, grinding, processing and distribution. The act of transforming coal into electricity is quite a production; coal is first ground to a fine chalky powder and added to combustion chambers of boilers before being burned at higher temperatures to produce hot gas and heat energy.

## What is an energy flow diagram? 
Energy flow diagram – a definition. Energy Flow Diagrams (often also referred to as Energy Flow Charts) are used to show energy and energy transformation visually and quantitatively. This may include primary energy used as raw fuels to feed into a system, energy supply, conversion or transformation, losses and energy being used.
