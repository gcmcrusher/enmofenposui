## Water Handbook 
The most desirable media size depends on the suspended solids characteristics as well as the effluent quality requirements and the specific filter design. In general, rapid sand filters use sand with an effective size of 0.35-0.60 mm (0.014-0.024 in.) and a maximum uniformity coefficient of 1.7.

## Drinking Water Treatment – Filtration
23.08.2019Filtration systems are used most often in home water treatment to remove sediment or iron, manganese, or sulfur particles. Filtration can also remove some bacteria from water. In mechanical filtration systems, water passes through a medium such as cloth or sand. Particles become trapped on the surface of or within the medium.

## Filters 
In rapid sand water treatments filters, finer sand grains are at the top of the sand layer with larger grains farther down into the water treatment filter. As a result, the water filter removes more suspended material in the first few cm thick of the filter. In the high rate filter, the media size decreases.

## The water treatment process 
Rapid gravity filters. The water is passed through a tank full of coarse sand. The sand traps particles as the water passes through. Slow sand filters. The water is then slowly filtered through large beds of much finer sand. This removes any remaining fine particles before the water goes for final treatment.
