## Ceramic Waste 
Experiment were carried out to determine the strength of concrete with ceramic waste coarse aggregate and quarry dust fine aggregate to compare them with the conventional concrete made (with crushed stone coarse aggregate). From the results show that compressive strength of concrete with quarry dust as aggregates is the highest with 30.82 MPa with density
