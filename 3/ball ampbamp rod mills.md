## Optimal Ball Diameter in a Mill
Investigations were carried out in a laboratory ball mill having the size of DxL = 160x200 mm with a ribbed inside surface of the drum. The mill ball loading was 40% by volume, the rotation rate was equal to 85% of the critical speed. Balls were made from steel: S4146, extra high quality, having hardness 62 2 HRC according to Rockwell.
