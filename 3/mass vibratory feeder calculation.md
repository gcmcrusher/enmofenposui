## Vibratory Feeder Bowl Basics: Choosing the right bowl for your 
01.04.2022When choosing a feeder bowl to orient your part, the first factor in making your decision should be the part size. The bigger the part, the bigger the bowl should be to accommodate the orienting process. A general rule is that the bowl should be 10 to 15 times the size of the part. For example, if you have a part that measures two inches then
