Rod mills: Horizontal rods are used instead of balls to grind. Granularity of the discharge material is 40-10 mm. The mill speed varies from 12 to 30 rpm. Planetary mill: High energy mill widely used for producing metal, alloy, and composite powders. Fluid energy grinding or Jet milling: The basic principle of fluid energy mill is to induce

## Indexing: Meaning and Methods 
The accuracy of spacing of teeth is very important particularly when the work is of precision character e.g., gear teeth, shafts, cutter teeth etc. The operation of rotating the job through a required angle between two successive cuts is termed as indexing. This is accomplished with the help of a milling attachment known as dividing head, which

## The history and processes of milling 
25.01.2011This transition required a new type of milling because stone mills were not sufficient to grind hard wheat. Secondly, flour was needed that would not go rancid on the long migrations that some people were beginning to make westwards across the continent. The last and, perhaps most important factor, was the invention of the purifier machine which uses air

## Stamp mill 
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps, loosely held vertically in a frame, in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp, the stamp falls onto the ore below, crushing the rock, and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.

01.01.2018Ball Milling. A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend bulk material into QDs/nanosize using different sized balls. The working principle is simple; impact and attrition size reduction take place as the ball drops from near the top of a rotating hollow cylindrical shell. The nanostructure size can be varied by varying the number and size of balls,

types of milling. If you are unsure of which method you should use ask somebody in the shop for assistance. Face milling uses the bottom of the mill to machine the work instead of the sides. The cutting comes from the combined action of cutting edges located on the face (or end) of the cutting tool as well as the edges on the periphery.

## SIZE REDUCTION 
Working: At low speeds, the ball roll over each other and attrition (rubbing action) will be the predominate mode of action. Thus, in the ball mill, impact or attrition or both are responsible for the size reduction. Advantages: It can produce very fine powder. Ball mill is used for both wet and dry grinding processes.

## Face milling 
A medium duty face mill that provides the lightest cutting ability. Capable of cutting depths of 6–8 mm within a feed range of 0.2 – 0.6 mm. For tough conditions in larger machining centres. Can be used with wiper inserts for milling surfaces with good finishes. First choice for medium duty face and shoulder milling.
