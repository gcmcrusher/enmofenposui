## Manufacturing of Bricks 
Preparation of clay. The clay for brick is prepared in the following order. Unsoiling: The top layer of the soil, about 200mm in depth, is taken out and thrown away. The clay in top soil is full of impurities and hence it is to be rejected for the purpose of preparing bricks. Digging: The clay is then dug out from the ground.

This paper reviews and summarizes the current knowledge and application of clay as a geopolymer material in production of geopolymer brick. As we understand, the nature of source materials give a significant impact to the strength of geopolymer. For example, geopolymer made from calcined source material such as calcined kaolin, fly ash, ground granulated blastfurnace

Sound and insulation: The characteristic thickness and density of the mud-brick wall reduces noise transmission and prevents noise from outside for a peaceful and quiet home. Durable: Clay bricks do not warp, rust, wear, peel, or fade over time, they do not harbor termites and appear more beautiful when they are manufactured.
