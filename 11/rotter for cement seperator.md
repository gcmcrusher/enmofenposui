A sill gasket made from a soft plastic material is designed to prevent moisture to seep from the foundation to the lumber frame. Sometimes just a simple plastic sheet is placed under the

## cement mill separator version 
Cement mill separator, or cement separator, is a type of equipment that was widely used in the cement grinding system and raw mill system of cement plants.The function of the separator is to separate the fine-sized particles from the coarse-sized particles, so as to avoid material condensation and over grinding in the mill, and improve the milling system's grinding efficiency.

01.03.2021If it is cement, I would be thinking about laying as sheet of 6 mil poly and then laying insulation boards on top. It's not the worlds most durable surface, but if you rarely need to walk on it, it should last a long time. That would stop the moisture but also stop heat loss. If you like that idea I'd for sure go with 2 inches, not just for heat loss but for durability, if you do need to
