## The Positive Effects of Mining on the Economy 
15.07.2021Other good things about mining's impact on the economy are the technological and productivity gains that help not only the mining industry, but are also transforming other sectors. And we consider one of the biggest and most positive impacts of mining are the boosts in jobs, wages and community funding that mining companies make to local towns and regions.

## Positive and Negative Effects of Mining
05.06.2018Mankind started mining for precious metals between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago. For the last century, mining has been one of our planet's largest industries (it generated 683 billion dollars in revenue in 2018 alone). This only underscores the fact that our desire for precious metals and minerals has grown exponentially since we first started digging through the topsoil

## 9 Ore Deposits and Economic Minerals – Mineralogy
Many different mineral commodities are important to modern society. However, when mineralogists think about mining, they are generally thinking of ore minerals that are the sources of important metals, or of minerals that have specific, highly valued properties (e.g., asbestos, micas, potash, and gems of all sorts).That is what we will focus on in most of the rest of this

28.10.2021Hematite, also spelled haematite, heavy and relatively hard oxide mineral, ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3 ), constitutes the most important iron ore because of its high iron content (70%) and its abundance. Besides, hematite is also one of few ores that can be classified into the field of jewelry and jade. Its name is derived from Greek haimatites

Impacts of strip mining: Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.

Reverse flotation of haematite from the tailings has been investigated using a batch, bench –scale mechanical cell. Characterisation of the fluorspar tailings was done and effects of various operating parameters on the recovery of
