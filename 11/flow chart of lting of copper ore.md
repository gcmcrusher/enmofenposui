## Copper 
Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29. It is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity.A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color.Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such

## COPPER Copper production 
About 80 % of primary copper production comes from low-grade or poor sulfide ores. After enrichment steps, the copper concentrates are usually treated by pyrometallurgical methods. Generally, copper extraction follows the sequence (see Figure below): 1. Beneficiation by froth flotation of ore to give copper concentrate
