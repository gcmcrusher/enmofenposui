## Standards for Heavy Liquid Separation analyses 
We have a heavy mineral sand project and we would want to use standards samples. Most of our analyses are done by heavy liquid separation to get the Total Heavy Minerals (THM). For now, we use a homogenized bulk sample for our standards but it's not accurate enough since the variability for both THM Slimes is too high. Any idea about how to

## Heavy Mineral Analysis 
Heavy minerals are separated from the lighter quartz and feldspar by immersion in a heavy liquid (2.8g/ml). The separation is carried out in a separation funnel. Heavy minerals sink to the bottom, while lighter minerals float to the surface.

## LMT Heavy Liquids. 
Mineral Separations . Heavy liquids have many uses. The most common use is for density separations of minerals in the laboratory. Samples are obtained from a core sample or from a process stream and placed in the heavy liquid at a predetermined density. The light fraction will float and the heavy fraction will sink. The resulting products can be weighed to determine the

## Sample Processing and Mineral Separation
Heavy Liquid Separation We regularly use two heavy liquids for density separations: Sodium Polytungstate (SPT) with a maximum density of ~2.89 and Di-iodomethane (DIM) with a maximum density of ~3.31. Both are recycled after use. Both sedimentary provenance and thermochronology projects require relatively large volumes of mineral separates.
