## clinker mill finish manipulation
The cooled clinker is transported to the enclosed clinker dome. Clinker is conveyed to a finish mill feed silo. This clinker, as well as gypsum and limestone, are transferred in appropriate proportions to the finishing mill system. The finish mill system consists of a complete Roller Press installation working in series with a ball mill.
