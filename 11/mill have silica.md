Silica exposure has been linked with TB for over a century. Silica exposures in stone crushing mills in India have been shown to increase the risk of acquiring active Tuberculosis (TB) by nearly seven-fold. A study conducted in India of over one hundred former stone crusher workers showed that 48% had TB alone or in combination with silicosis.
