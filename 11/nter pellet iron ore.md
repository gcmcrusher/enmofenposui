## Pelletizing 
Pelletizing iron ore is undertaken due to the excellent physical and metallurgical properties of iron ore pellets. Iron ore pellets are spheres of typically 6–16 mm (0.24–0.63 in) to be used as raw material for blast furnaces.They typically contain 64–72% Fe and various additional material adjusting the chemical composition and the metallurgic properties of the pellets.
