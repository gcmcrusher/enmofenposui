Jul 16, 2019 The effect of the addition of quarry dust was studied on compaction properties of clayey soil. The quarry dust was used in proportion of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% by weight of dry soil. It was found that 30% quarry dust resulted in an optimum mix and was recommended for use in construction .

Sudhir S.Kapgate and S.R.Satone (2013) investigated the use of quarry dust as a partial replacement for sand in concrete. They discovered that increasing the dust content by up to 30% increases the compressive strength of concrete; however, increasing the dust content by more than 30% gradually decreases the compressive strength.

## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
Crusher dust (quarry waste) is by product of stone crushers while producing coarse aggregate. Instead of disposing them in landfills, it can be best utilized as partial replacement to sand. In crusher dust, the particles (% finer than 150 microns) are generally high, a major concern limiting its percentage replacement to minimum with sand in a concrete mix. It can be replaced to the

By replacement of quarry dust, the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and can also solve the problem of natural sand scarcity. The availability of sand at low cost as a fine aggregate in concrete is not suitable and that is the reason to search for an alternative material. Quarry dust satisfies the reason behind the alternative material as a substitute for sand at very low cost. It

It is advisable to replace some quantities of the existing soil and be replaced by quarry dust since quarry dust is a waste product from crushing of stones. Lastly, about 30% of the existing soil should be replaced by either the mixture of lateritic soil and quarry dust or the soil there should be used as subbase which may not be economical.

3.2 Quarry Dust Quarry dust is a by-product of the crushing process which is a concentrated material to use as aggregates for concreting purpose, especially as fine aggregates. In quarrying activities, the rock has been crushed into various sizes; during the process the dust generated is called quarry dust and it is formed as waste.
