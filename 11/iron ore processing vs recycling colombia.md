## Study the Recycling of Red Mud in Iron Ore Sintering Process
ABSTRACT. Red mud (RM), the by-product generated during the alumina extraction process, is considered a valuable secondary raw material, since iron (20-54%) represents its major constituent. Accordingly, the suitability of recycling this RM in the sintering process of Egyptian iron ore was studied. The effect of adding different amounts of RM

## and what does it mean for coal and iron ore? 
Increased scrap use could erode metallurgical coal and iron ore consumption. Metallurgical coal is the primary driver of CO2 emissions in virgin iron production. Coal demand will decrease when environmental concerns come to the forefront of policy. High-cost miners exporting to Atlantic basin customers will be most at risk.
