## Chapter 6.4 Chromium 
The ore has not been found in the pure form; its highest grade contains about 55% chromic oxide (1). In Europe, ferrochromium is produced mainly in Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Sweden and former Yugoslavia. Potassium chromate is produced mainly in Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Sodium chromate and dichromate are now among the most important

## Chromium, Chemical Element 
The abundance of chromium in the Earth's crust is about 100 to 300 parts per million. It ranks about number 20 among the chemical elements in terms of their abundance in the earth. Chromium does not occur as a free element. Today, nearly all chromium is produced from chromite, or chrome iron ore (FeCr 2 O 4 ).

## Understanding Chrome Ore Supply
Chrome ore prices have been running relatively stably in the past decade around 35 yuan/mtu. The fluctuation of chrome ore price is somehow correlated with chrome ore port inventory. In, as chrome ore port inventory fell below 900,000 mt, the spot price of 40-42% South Africa chrome ore concentrate rose rapidly to a high of 76 yuan/mtu.

Bauxite ore has a wide range of uses. Ninety percent bauxite is used in the production of alumina and aluminum. Sometimes by-products such as metallic aluminum ore and sometimes vanadium and gallium are obtained from bauxite. Refractory products are obtained from bauxite and high alumina firebrick and synthetic mullite are obtained. It is also used in iron
