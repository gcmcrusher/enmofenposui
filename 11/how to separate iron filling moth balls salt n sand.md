## How to Remove and Prevent Moss in Lawns 
For example, you can fill a garden sprayer with 2 gallons of lukewarm water and mix in a box of baking soda, then spray this solution on the patches of moss. Another remedy is to mix ordinary dish soap (Dawn Ultra is a preferred product) and water in a garden sprayer (5 ounces per gallon of water). This mixture will quickly kill moss.

(iii) Salt and sand. The density of salt and sand are different from each other. Sad is heavier than salt and has 2.65 g/cm 3 density. Therefore, by shaking the mixture of salt and sand, separation can be done. In this process, the salt will separate up and the sand being heavier will deposit down forming the layer.

## Ball Mill 
Conical Ball Mills differ in mill body construction, which is composed of two cones and a short cylindrical part located between them (Fig. 2.12).Such a ball mill body is expedient because efficiency is appreciably increased. Peripheral velocity along the conical drum scales down in the direction from the cylindrical part to the discharge outlet; the helix angle of balls is decreased

Capping involves the replacement of a portion of the sand with anthracite. In this conversion, a 2-6 in. layer of 0.4-0.6 mm (0.016-0.024 in.) sand is removed from the surface of a bed and replaced with 4-8 in. of 0.9 mm (0.035 in.) anthracite. If an increase in capacity is desired, a larger amount of sand is replaced.
