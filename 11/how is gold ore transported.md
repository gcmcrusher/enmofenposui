## Modder East 
Gold One progressed Modder East from a greenfield exploration project to a full feasibility study, resulting in the mine's first 240 oz of gold being poured from underground ore on July 21, 2009. Continuous and commercial production was declared at the mine on December 1, 2009, and Modder East's first ton of gold was poured ten months later.

## How are Gold and Silver Bars Made? 
31.07.2022Step 1 - Mining and Extraction. First, the metal needs to be located and extracted. In the past, hydraulic mining was used to move and separate gold from deposits with high pressure water jets. Nowadays, gold and silver ore is typically mined from the ground using explosives and other techniques.

## How do we extract minerals? 
The primary methods used to extract minerals from the ground are: Underground mining. Surface (open pit) mining. Placer mining. The location and shape of the deposit, strength of the rock, ore grade, mining costs, and current market price of the commodity are some of the determining factors for selecting which mining method to use.

It involves drilling a section of ore at the very bottom of the deposit and then blasting to make the roof collapse. Gravity then takes over, as the ore above the blast site fractures and collapses in succession as support is withdrawn. The collapsed ore is hauled out the mine for processing [source: Great Mining ].
