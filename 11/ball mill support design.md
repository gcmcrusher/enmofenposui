## Milling Machine: Parts and Working 
13.05.2016The working of milling machine is as follow. 1. First the cutting tool is set at the arbor which is connected to the spindle. 2. The knee is moved downward. 3. Now the work piece is clamped on the table by using clamping screw. 4. All the controlling points are set to zero like knee position, saddle position etc.

## Ball Valve 
18.11 Ball Valves. Ball valves consist of a spherical obturator with a cylindrical hole, usually of the same diameter as the pipe, although it can be smaller. Operation is by rotation (1/4 turn) of a shaft mounted, often horizontally, with its axis at right angles to the cylindrical hole.

## Ball Screw Selection 
Ball Screws. The ball screw drive is an assembly that converts rotary motion to linear motion (or vice versa). It consists of a ball screw and a ball nut packaged as an assembly with recirculating balls. The interface between the ball screw and the nut is made by balls which roll in matching ball forms. With rolling elements, the ball screw
