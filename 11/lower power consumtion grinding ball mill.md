To achieve the required grinding fineness, the workload of the ball mill is bound to increase, and subsequently, the energy consumption and power consumption will also increase. In order to reduce the feed particle size of the grinding ore, the particle size of the crushed ore product is required to be small, which is, more crushing and less grinding.

## What Factors Will Influence Ball Mill Grinding Efficiency?
26/03/2021If the grinding product is too coarse, the monomer dissociation degree of the mineral is low; if the grinding product is too fine, it will easily cause the material to be over ground, which will not only increase the energy consumption of the ball mill and the consumption of the grinding medium, but also reduce the productivity.
