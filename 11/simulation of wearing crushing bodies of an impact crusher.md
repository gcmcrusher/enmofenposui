## Application of Orthogonal Experiments in Simulation and Optimization 
In this paper, the traveling characteristic value of moving jaw of jaw crusher is studied by optimization experiment. The traveling characteristic value can reflect the relationship between capacity and energy consumption of jaw crusher. When it is around 2.5, the capacity of jaw crusher is high and the energy consumption is low. The virtual prototype model of jaw
