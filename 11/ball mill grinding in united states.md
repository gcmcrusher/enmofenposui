Ball mill is typically used to grind and/or blend materials and it can be done wet or dry. It can be used to mix ceramic powders, disperse particles in solvents, homogenize ceramic slurries, etc. Ball mills operate by rotating plastic jars around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.

Conical Ball Mills differ in mill body construction, which is composed of two cones and a short cylindrical part located between them (Fig. 2.12).Such a ball mill body is expedient because efficiency is appreciably increased. Peripheral velocity along the conical drum scales down in the direction from the cylindrical part to the discharge outlet; the helix angle of balls is decreased
