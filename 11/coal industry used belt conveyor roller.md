## The Ultimate Rotating Resistance of the Belt Conveyors Rollers
belt conveyors are widely used in various transport systems. The major cost for their operation consists, most often, of the means for rollers maintenance especially when belt conveyors are in the dusty explosive environment, for example, in mining industry. To prevent or reduce probability of fires, it is necessary to prevent jamming of rollers.
