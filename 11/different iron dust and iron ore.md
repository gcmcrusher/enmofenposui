## Iron Ore Mining 
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## Which theory is stronger, that iron came from outside or was 
07.08.2014All matter on earth came from dust, a meteor or a comet. Some of that matter has changed from one element to another, but not iron. Thus all iron came via meteor. It isn't a matter of tracing this theory through history, because we know which elements decay into other elements and none of the ones found on earth end in iron.

In most ports the cargo is loaded wet to reduce dust. Much of this moisture settles on passage and is pumped out through the ship's hold bilges which means that less weight is discharged than is loaded.

18.09.2020Bog iron is formed when ground-water picks up iron from iron-ore deposits, where that iron is then oxidized under acidic conditions to form chunks of iron minerals (goethite, magnetite, hematite, etc.), typically in smallish chunks. Bog iron is much easier to smelt because it contains fewer impurities than iron ore in rock deposits, but the

Magnetite is a mineral and one of the main iron ores, with the chemical formula Fe 2+ Fe 3+ 2 O 4.It is one of the oxides of iron, and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. With the exception of extremely rare native iron deposits, it is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth.
