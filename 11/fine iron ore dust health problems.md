## Adelaide Research Scholarship: Iron
Abstract: Different lung diseases including lung cancer are the major occupational diseases among the workers of iron ore dust. However, health hazards that arise due to exposures to the ore dust vary considerably due to its variable composition in different mines. Iron oxide and silica predominantly contribute to its toxicological properties.

## Safe carriage of Iron ores other iron concentrates in bulk
In the carriage of iron ore, the following precautions should be taken: Iron ores are heavy cargoes which occupy a small area for a large weight, ie they have a low stowage factor (between 0.240.80 m3/tonne). It is therefore important that the tanktop has sufficient strength to carry certain iron ores. If a bulk carrier loads a homogeneous
