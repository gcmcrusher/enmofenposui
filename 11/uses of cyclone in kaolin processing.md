Wet processing of kaolin begins with blunging to produce a slurry, which then is fractionated into coarse and fine fractions using centrifuges, hydrocyclones, or hydroseparators. At this step in the process, various chemical methods, such as bleaching, and physical and magnetic methods, may be used to refine the material.

## Design and Construction of a Parallel Cyclone System for Kaolin 
Abstract: Kaolin is a very important substance commonly used in many industrial chemical production processes due to its physical properties such as whiteness and brightness in addition to its chemically inert nature. In its raw form, kaolin contains quite a few numbers of different kinds of impurities that must be removed before it is used for production of other chemicals.

In the dry process, raw kaolin is directly fed into the crusher. The crushed kaolin is milled and passed through a classifier and a blower before finally passing through a cyclone for grain size classification and storage. In Nigeria, over 90 per cent of kaolin industries use this method because it is less tedious.

In the dry process, the raw material is crushed to the desired size, dried in rotary dryers, pulverized and air-floated to remove most of the coarse grit.

## Beneficiation Process and Influencing Factors of Sandy Kaolin
The granularity of sandy kaolin is classified according to -150 mesh, -200 mesh and -325 mesh. (2) Processing capacity: when kaolin is purified, the processing capacity is related to product quality. Under the same conditions, the larger the processing capacity, the smaller the product whiteness improvement range.

## Kaolin has a wide range of uses after PTMS Magnetic Separator 
PTMS magnetic separator can remove the iron (FE2O3) inside. Kaolin is one of the four non-metallic minerals, mainly used in ceramics, papermaking, rubber, enamel, coating and other fields. There are many kinds of kaolin, which can be classified according to the texture and sand content. The uses of each type of kaolin are different:

## kaolin clay mining and processing 
The first step in processing kaolin clay is to slurry it in a blunger with water and a dispersing agent. Degritting using screens, cyclones and hydro-classifiers is the next step. The minus 325 mesh degritted clay is fractionated using centrifugal sizers to produce the fine fractions demanded by the various markets.

## Kaolin: processing, properties and applications 
Kaolin is one of the most versatile industrial materials. It is chemically in- ert over a relatively wide pH range, is white in color and has good covering power when used as a pigment or extender. Kaolin is soft and non-abrasive, and has a low conductivity of heat and electricity.

Probably the most common application of this is the cyclone separator. Combined forces are also used in some powder classifiers such as the rotary mechanical classifier and in ring dryers. Cyclones. Cyclones are often used for the removal from air streams of particles of about 10 mm or more diameter. They are also used for separating particles
