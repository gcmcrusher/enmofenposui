May 21, 2021 Silicon is produced by very high temperature processing of silica (sand) whereas organic solar cells can be cast from a solution. This means the energy payback time (i.e. the time it takes for the solar panels to produce the same energy as went into making them) is potentially much shorter for organic solar cells which is great for the environment.

Ball milling is a mechanical technique that is broadly used to grind powders into fine particles [134–141]. The reactants are generally broken apart using solvent molecules in the traditional method; but in ball milling, reactants are broken by using mechanical forces. The term mechanochemistry has been introduced very recently [142].

## Ball mill 
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering. It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. The axis of the
