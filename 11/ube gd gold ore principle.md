## Gold Price Chart
The gold/silver ratio is simply the amount of silver required to buy a single ounce of gold. For example, if gold is at $1200 per ounce and silver is at $15 per ounce, the ratio would be calculated as $1200/$15 = 80. This means it would take 80 ounces of silver to buy a single ounce of gold. Charts of this ratio may potentially be useful, as
