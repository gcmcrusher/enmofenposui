## Studies on Beneficiation of Manganese Ore through High 
Upgradation techniques like wet sieving and magnetic separation were used to evaluate the beneficiation potential of manganese ore. During wet sieving, manganese content in raw ore was upgraded from 27% to a maximum value of 38% in the concentrate with a recovery of 30%. Size classification was found to have no measurable effect on manganese grade in

He pointed out that the grade of the domestic manganese ores would be considered high if the same grade were found in copper ores. The selling price of electrolytic manganese and electrolytic copper are roughly the same. In addition to electrolytic manganese, he believes that domestic ores should be used to make exceptionally high grade products.
