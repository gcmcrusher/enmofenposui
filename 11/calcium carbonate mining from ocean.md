## What is Ocean Acidification?
The Chemistry. When carbon dioxide (CO 2) is absorbed by seawater, chemical reactions occur that reduce seawater pH, carbonate ion concentration, and saturation states of biologically important calcium carbonate minerals.These chemical reactions are termed ocean acidification or OA for short. Calcium carbonate minerals are the building blocks for the skeletons and

## Calcium Carbonate In Gold Mining Industry
What Is Calcium Carbonate And How Can It Affect Mining. Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the formula CaCO3. It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone, which is a type of sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcite) and is the main component of pearls and the shells of marine organisms,

## Calcium cycle 
Biogenic calcium carbonate is formed when marine organisms, such as coccolithophores, corals, pteropods, and other mollusks transform calcium ions and bicarbonate into shells and exoskeletons of calcite or aragonite, both forms of calcium carbonate. This is the dominant sink for dissolved calcium in the ocean. Dead organisms sink to the bottom of the ocean,

## Calcium Carbonate Production and Contribution to Coastal 
18/05/2017Calcium carbonate production in coastal environments. Biological production of calcium carbonate in the oceans is an important process. Although carbonate is produced in the open ocean (pelagic, see Chapter 5), this chapter concentrates on production in coastal waters (neritic) because this contributes sediment to the coast through skeletal breakdown

## Calcium carbonate 
Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC) - created by nature over millions of years. Most calcium carbonate deposits are made up of the remains of marine organisms that have sedimented to the bottom of a shallow sea. These organisms, such as crustaceans, algae, and coral, absorb calcium carbonate from the water and use it to form their skeletons and shells.
