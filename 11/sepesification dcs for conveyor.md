## Parcel Conveyor Specification Guide 
Singulation: Singulators organize bulk flows of cartons into uniformly separated and spaced lines. This organizes parcels to be fed to sorters, scanners, packaging machinery and other functions and is critical for most DCs. Gapping: Gapping conveyors create uniform gaps between cartons, and tend to be roller conveyor based.

Steel belts came along in 1902, and underground conveyor belts followed shortly after that in 1905. Once Henry Ford famously used a conveyor belt system in his assembly line in 1913, belts began gaining a lot more attention. Changes and developments came in spades. By 1970, the first plastic conveyor belt had arrived. 2.
