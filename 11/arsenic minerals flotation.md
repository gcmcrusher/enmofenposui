21/12/2020In the team's experiments, methanotrophic bacteria used organic carbon in methane as an electron donor to reductively dissolve the minerals, freeing sequestered arsenic. Methane is commonly found in aquifers contaminated with arsenic. The discovery of this new pathway for arsenic mobilization, coupled with the common co-occurrence of methane

## Arsenic
Abstract This paper describes the application of a shortcut computational method to analyse and compare alternative flotation circuits developed to treat high-arsenic copper ores. The methodology uses a superstructure that considers the many different available elements of the flotation circuits and compares the results. The circuits were evaluated using radial/spider
