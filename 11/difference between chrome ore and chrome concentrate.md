## Efficiently optimise ore sorting • STEINERT
With preconcentration there are customers who can double the grade of their material. The STEINERT XSS T EVO 5.0 with 'dual energy' x-ray transmission (XRT) is ideally suited for ore sorting because the x-ray radiation can penetrate stones with particle sizes up to 100 mm. Metals can thus be detected, even when they are not on the surface.

As specific gravity is just a comparison, it can be applied across any units. The density of pure water is also 62.4 lbs/cu.ft (pounds per cubic foot) and if we know that ammonium nitrate has a sg of 0.73 then we can calculate that its density is 0.73 x 62.4 = 45.552 lbs/cu.ft.

26.11.2014Pelletizing of iron ore was started in the 1950s to facilitate the utilization of finely ground iron ore concentrates in steel production. For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely, the straight travelling grate (STG) process and the grate kiln (GK) process. In the STG process, a stationary bed of pellets is

## Sintering Characteristics of Indian Chrome Ore Fines
11.08.2009Chrome ore concentrate consists of high-temperature melting oxides such as Cr2O3, MgO, and Al2O3. The presence of these refractory constituents makes the ore a very high melting mineral. Hence, it is difficult to produce sinter from chrome ore by a pyrometallurgical route. Currently, chrome ore is ground to below 75 μm, pelletized, heat
