## Greenstone belt 
Een Greenstone belt is een geologische zone van een kraton. Greenstone belts bestaan uit een afwisseling van ultramafische of mafische vulkanische gesteenten en sedimentaire gesteenten. Meestal zijn ze licht tot zwaarder gemetamorfoseerd. Deze metamorfose is vaak groenschist-facies, waarbij het groene mineraal chloriet wordt gevormd. De meeste gesteenten in

## Greenstone belt 
Greenstone belts are large regions of very ancient metamorphosed volcanic rocks. The name comes from the green colour of the minerals in the rocks. Chlorite, actinolite and other green amphiboles are the typical green minerals.. Greenstone belts were originally formed of igneous rocks, such as basalt.The belts formed at ancient oceanic spreading centers and in volcanic

## Cratons and Greenstone Belts 
What are cratons and greenstone belts? As mentioned elsewhere, through the process of differentiation the earth is sorting itself by density: the heavy stuff is sinking towards the core and the lighter stuff is accumulating at the surface, kind of like scum.. A craton is a continent-sized raft of low density felsic rock (commonly granite) which has been purified by the earth and
