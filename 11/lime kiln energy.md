## Burning the Bones of the Earth: Lime Kilns 
It is not necessary to build a kiln in order to burn limestone to make quicklime = burned lime = caustic lime = CaO. You can burn lime in piles on top of the ground. Start with a layer of fuel wood 5 feet wide and 8 inches thick. Add a 4-inch thick layer of limestone.

The electric power consumption of an efficient plant is around 20 kWh per tonne of lime. This additional input is the equivalent of around 20 kg CO 2 per ton if the electricity is coal-generated. Thus, total emission may be around 1 tonne of CO 2 for every tonne of lime even in efficient industrial plants, but is typically 1.3 t/t .

## Lime Kiln Modifications 
The lime kiln calcines the CaCO3 in lime mud to generate CaO. Several modifications are possible to decrease energy consumption in the kiln. Evaporation energy can be reduced by installing high efficiency filters to decrease the water content of the kiln intake. Higher efficiency refractory insulation bricks can be fitted to increase heat transfer in the kiln.

In recent years, with the sharp rise of energy prices, the proportion of fuel cost in lime production is increasing, and the fuel consumed by calcining lime accounts for 30-40% of the total. The high cost of fuel has led to a sharp decline in profits The existence and development of lime production, which directly or indirectly uses coal as fuel, are facing great challenges.

The graphic was created for natural gas-fired PFR lime kilns. The benchmark values (BM) for CO 2 emissions already set by the European Commission until 2025 have been taken into account. In 2013 the value was 954 kg/t lime, which was reduced to 725 kg/t lime in March 2021. This value will remain constant until 2025.

lime kiln gas made the solid fuel mixed feed lime kiln the num-ber one choice for the sugar industry. In case of lime kilns, the switch from coke/anthracite to natural gas is an option used to reduce CO 2 emissions. In North Africa and North America the situation has already changed and natural gas as lime kiln fuel is gaining more and more
