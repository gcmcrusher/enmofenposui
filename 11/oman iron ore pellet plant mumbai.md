All effective methods of direct reduction actually use the same process: rich iron ore (fine concentrate or pellets) is reduced by a special gas mixture up to the iron content of 85-90%. This explains why the production of direct-reduced iron is mainly concentrated in countries with large reserves of oil (oilwell gas), natural gas and iron ore, as well as limited scrap resources.

## Iron ore 
There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.
