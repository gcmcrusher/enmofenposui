## What Is A Kilowatt
A kilowatt is 1,000 watts, which is a measure of power. A kilowatt-hour is a measure of the amount of energy a certain machine needs to run for one hour. So, if you have a 1,000 watt drill, it takes 1,000 watts (or one kW) to make it work. If you run that drill for one hour, you'll have used up one kilowatt of energy for that hour, or one kWh.
