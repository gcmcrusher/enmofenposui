## Uranium Mining Overview 
Mill chemistry. The crushed and ground ore, or the underground ore in the case of ISL mining, is leached with sulfuric acid: UO 3 + 2H + ==== UO 2 2+ + H 2 O UO 2 2+ + 3SO 4 2-==== UO 2 (SO 4) 3 4-. The UO 2 is oxidised to UO 3.. With some ores, carbonate leaching is used to form a soluble uranyl tricarbonate ion: UO 2 (CO 3) 3 4-.This can then be precipitated with an alkali,
