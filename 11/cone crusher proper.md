## What is Cone Crusher? 
02.10.2020Both these shafts work in collaboration for the proper functioning of the cone crusher. The countershaft is mainly used to rotate the main shaft with the help of pinions, drive pulley, and electric motor. The mantle is another main part of the cone crusher which is attached at the top of the main shaft. Above the mantle, there is one more part of the cone crusher

## A review of modeling and control strategies for cone crushers 
15.08.2021As electricity prices continue to increase and more demand is placed on mineral processing plants towards sustainable operations, proper control and optimization of cone crushers, which are infamously known for being energy inefficient (Holmberg et al., 2017) (although still more energy efficient than tumbling mills), will become more important.

## Jaw Crusher vs Cone Crusher: A Comparison 
Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.
