Roasting is a process of heating a sulfide ore to a high temperature in the presence of air. It is a step in the processing of certain ores.More specifically, roasting is often a metallurgical process involving gas–solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s). Often before roasting, the ore has already been partially purified, e.g. by froth

## Electromagnetic Technology to Utilize Zinc
03.07.2020In this work, a technological scheme for the coprocessing of dissimilar zinc-containing wastes, namely, slags obtained from the autogenous smelting of copper-zinc concentrates and dusts (sludges) from gas purification during blast furnace and steelmaking production, was developed. The proposed technology was confirmed to achieve the efficient

Once concentrated, the zinc ore is transferred to smelters for the production of zinc or zinc oxide. The primary product of most zinc companies is slab zinc, which is produced in 5 grades: special high grade, high grade, intermediate, brass special, and prime western. The 4 U. S. primary smelters also produce sulfuric acid as a byproduct.

## Zinc Smelting from Ore 
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc. It has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals, e.g. iron, because in contrast, zinc has a low boiling point. At temperatures typically used for smelting metals, zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace, unless
