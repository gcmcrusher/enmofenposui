References to large scale heap leaching describing copper extraction from oxide and sulphide copper ores at Rio Tinto appeared from around 1752. The crushed ore was stacked together with timber which was subsequently set alight roasting the sulphides. Water was then percolated through the heap and the resulting copper sulphate solution

## Environmental Containment Solutions for Heap Leaching 
Heap leaching is commonly used in gold, copper, and uranium mining operations to extract minerals from ore. Both Enviro Liner 4000 and 6000HD are resistant to cyanide, sulfuric acid, and arsenic and are easily prefabricated and installed.

Then the ore is crushed and screened, with the fine sulfide ore (~-0.5 mm) going to froth flotation cells for recovery of copper. The coarser ore goes to the heap leach, where the copper is subjected to a dilute sulfuric acid solution to dissolve the copper. Then the leach solution containing the dissolved copper is subjected to a process

Acid Method For High Cocentration Of Gold Ore. This method is an acid heap leaching method like that of the copper method in that it utilises sulfuric acid instead of cyanide solution to dissolve the target minerals from crushed ore. The amount of sulfuric acid required is much higher than for copper ores, as high as 1,000 kg of acid per tonne

## extractrion process of copper from ore 
The techniques for extraction of copper from oxidized ores are quite different from those employed for the sulfide ores. The oxidized ores, consisting of the silicates, carbonates and sulfates, are treated by several methods, all involving some form of leaching of the crushed ore with sulfuric acid to produce impure solutions of copper sulfate.
