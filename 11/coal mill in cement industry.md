## Which type of coal use by cement industry. 
8 Answers. Bituminous coals make the best coke and are in any case the most common, and these are most often used in the cement industry, although steam coals are occasionally used. When burning a pulverised fuel, higher volatiles are preferred because they speed up ignition and allow a coarser grind to be used.
