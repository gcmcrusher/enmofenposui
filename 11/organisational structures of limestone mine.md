## Geotechnical Characterization of Jordanian Limestone
Full knowledge of the physical and mechanical behavior of limestone rocks is required for the safe design of structures. Little work has been done to characterize the physical and mechanical properties of Jordanian limestone especially under watery environment. Therefore, in this study the physical and mechanical properties of some Jordanian limestone were investigated.
