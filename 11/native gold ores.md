## Minerals 
This paper describes native gold in ore-bearing breccias with realgar-orpiment cement from the Vorontsovskoe gold deposit (Northern Urals, Russia). Particular attention is paid to the morphological features of native gold and its relation to other minerals. The latter include both common (orpiment, barite, pyrite, prehnite, realgar) and rare species (Tl and Hg sulfosalts,

Gold has been mined from most countries on Earth. Although the mineral occurs in many different types of rock and ore deposits, the deposits themselves are surprisingly similar. For example, most gold occurs in native form--that is, pure or nearly pure--and most gold is

## How Is Gold Formed and Where Does it Come From?
18.05.2015Gold Comes From Outer Space. Gold, the shiny yellow metal prized for its beauty and malleability and used in many different industries, is actually created inside massive stars when they explode into a supernova. Of course, after a star supernovas and forms gold, the precious metal has to travel to Earth in some way.
