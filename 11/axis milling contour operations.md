## Types of Milling Operation 
30/10/2019Posted on October 30, 2019 by AS Precision. Milling operations are broadly classified as peripheral milling and face milling: Peripheral Milling. Generally, peripheral, or plain, milling is accomplished with the workpiece surface mounted to the milling machine table and the milling cutter mounted on a standard milling machine arbor.

## 3D Contour 
The Contour strategy is designed to give you an optimal finish for steep regions in your geometry. It is typically applied to areas where the slope exceeds an angle of 30 degrees. The Contour algorithm virtually slices the geometry into horizontal layers. At every layer, the toolpath then machines along the edge of the two-dimensional geometry

## Fast, Accurate Contour Milling with High Surface Definition
HSC milling technology has a decisive influence on manufacturing processes in mold and die making as well as in aerospace technology. The required feed velocities place machine controls before a great challenge. In the conflict of interests between machining time, contour accuracy and surface definition, the Heidenhain iTNC 530 control ensures

## Profile milling 
Profile milling covers multi-axis milling of convex and concave shapes in two and three dimensions. The larger the component and the more complicated the configuration to the machine, the more important the profile milling process planning becomes. The machining process should be divided into at least three operation types: Roughing/semi-roughing.

The trendsetting 5-axis technology in hyper MILL can typically yield time savings of more than 25 per cent while lowering tool wear and increasing contour accuracy for more cost-efficient production thanks to continuous machining. Challenging geometries such as high and steep walls require many different tool inclinations in precisely delineated milling areas.
