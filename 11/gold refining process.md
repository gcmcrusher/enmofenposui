## How gold is made 
Gold, recognizable by its yellowish cast, is one of the oldest metals used by humans. As far back as the Neolithic period, humans have collected gold from stream beds, and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C., when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry, religious artifacts, and utensils such

## Platinum Refining Process
Platinum scrap such as platinum coins, palladium PD and platinum wire is weighed and then smelted. As the platinum scrap liquefies in the furnace or melts under a blowtorch, flux is mixed in to separate the pure platinum from other precious and non-precious metals. A sample is removed for assaying, which is the process of measuring the platinum

## Gold Refinery Prices 
You need to pay special attention to the rise of gold prices if you send scrap to refine regularly. When it goes up, your settlements, no matter which refinery you work with, should follow the same patterns and fluctuate like the gold market. If gold is projected to grow in 2022, then the gold refinery prices should go up.

Unfortunately, the entire process can take a couple of days. For economical refining; often a different refining process, known as the Miller Chlorination Process, is used to separate gold to a purity of about 99.5%.

For centuries and decades there has been innovations in the way that gold has been mined and processed. Mining for gold in modern times is an intense but sophisticated method. According to experts most surface gold or alluvial gold has been discovered, leading to the fact that nowadays gold is mostly extracted from the earth. In order to do this technology, expertise and

## The Mining Process 
This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver. 6. Elution and Electrowinning — The loaded carbon is fed into an elution column where the bullion is washed off. The barren carbon is recycled. The wash solution—pregnant electrolyte—is passed through electrowinning cells where gold and silver is won onto stainless steel cathodes.

## How Gold Is Mined 
Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity – known as dor – typically containing between 60-90% gold.
