## Azeotrope 
A well-known example of a positive azeotrope is 95.63% ethanol and 4.37% water (by mass), which boils at 78.2 C. Ethanol boils at 78.4 C, water boils at 100 C, but the azeotrope boils at 78.2 C, which is lower than either of its constituents. Indeed, 78.2 C is the minimum temperature at which any ethanol/water solution can boil at atmospheric pressure.

Froth flotation separates materials based on their association with water. Association with water means that they are either hydrophilic (water-loving) or hydrophobic (water-repelling). Other than the water association, froth flotation also depends on factors like the density of materials, as it is a concentration process. A typical froth flotation includes 5 steps- Liberation, Conditioning

frother dosage decreases froth volume and produces a ten-dency to effervesce. The lower boiling fractions produce a more fragile froth and are somewhat more selective [7, 14]. Typical specifications for flotation grade cresylic acids were oC, with no more than 2 percent below 190oC, no less than 75 percent distilling below 235oC,

Flotation cells' froth transport characteristics can be consistently correlated with flotation performance, as they affect the time that particles reside in the froth phase and, consequently, the probability that they survive the froth phase; (Li et al., 2014).

Introduction. In the process of coal preparation, flotation is used to separate the ash-forming mineral matter and the carbonaceous materials of fine coal below 0.5 mm in size [1,2].This process is widely applied in countries such as China, USA, Australia, Canada and India [].Flotation columns are extensively studied and used as an efficient coal flotation equipment

## Froth Flotation and its Application to Concentration of Low 
Froth flotation is a process used to separate minerals, suspended in liquids, by attaching them to gas bubbles to provide selective levitation of the solid particles. It is most extensively used process for the separation of chemi-cally similar minerals, and to concentrate ores for econo-mical smelting. Flotation is a selective process and can be used to achieve
