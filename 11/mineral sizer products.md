A theoretical approach to determination of particle size distribution of crushing products was presented by Kolmogorow (1941) and Epstein (1947), who proved that for a multi-stage comminution process, the particle size distributions of products are log-normal. The product particle size distribution depends on the crushing process intensity (stage).
