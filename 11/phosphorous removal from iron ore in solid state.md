The results showed that high temperature, low basicity and high carbon content is conducive for the apatite in iron ore to reduce into molten iron, but not conducive to the removal of phosphorus. Through optimisation of process parameters, dephosphorisation rate of high phosphorus hematite is more than 60 per cent by solid state reduction

Direct reduced iron (DRI) is produced by the direct reduction of iron ore in the solid state. Reducing gases (carbon monoxide and hydrogen) are used to remove the oxygen from the iron ore, resulting in a highly metallised iron product in pellet or lump form (depending on the type of iron ore feedstock, pellets or lumpy ore). The resulting DRI product is very porous in nature

In the carriage of iron ore, the following precautions should be taken: Iron ores are heavy cargoes which occupy a small area for a large weight, ie they have a low stowage factor (between 0.240.80 m3/tonne). It is therefore important that the tanktop has sufficient strength to carry certain iron ores. If a bulk carrier loads a homogeneous
