## Properties: An Introduction to Copper 
Copper is tough and ductile, but is valuable due its ability to conduct electricity. While it is suited to many applications most centre around its excellent electrical conductivity (e.g. busbars and electric wire). Other uses utilise its corrosion resistance (e.g. water pipes and heat exchangers).

## Copper Ore – Minecraft Wiki
Copper ore is a mineral block found underground. Deepslate copper ore is the deepslate variant of copper ore, usually found deeper underground. Copper ore can be generated anywhere on the Overworld in the form of blobs. In Java Edition, copper ore tries to generate 6 times per chunk in groups from 0 to 16, in layers 0 to 96, being most common in layers 47 and 48 and

## Copper Ore 
Copper ore is an ore that can be obtained from copper deposits or copper rocks. Copper ore can be obtained by mining a copper deposit, which spawns in copper resource islands around the player's island. Mining the copper deposit will drop 30 - 50 copper ore. Copper rocks naturally generate on Buffalkor Island and in the Diamond Mines. Mining a copper rock yields

## Metals from Ores: An Introduction 
Ores that are generally processed for only a single metal are those of iron, aluminium, chromium, tin, mercury, manganese, tungsten, and some ores of copper. Gold ores may yield only gold, but silver is a common associate. Nickel ores are always associated with cobalt, while lead and zinc always occur together in ores.

Copper Introduction The first discovery of copper mineralization in Jordan was in the Fifties thof the 20 century in Wadi Dana/ Wadi Araba area. In ancient times, there were many mining activities for extracting copper as indicated by the slags and old mines in Khirbet El-Nahas, Wadi Jaryia and other localities.
