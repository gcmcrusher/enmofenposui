## Grinding 
Grinding ratios vary from 2 to 200, although high grinding ratios frequently give rise to poor surface integrity. For form grinding wheels are dressed to shape using diamond dressing tools or by "crush dressing". Materials: Ferrous, non-ferrous, polymers and ceramics are ground, as long as workpiece is softer than the abrasive grit.

Soft non-ferrous metals - Initial grinding is recommended with 320 grit SiC abrasive paper followed by 400, 600, 800 and 1200 grit SiC paper. Because these materials are relatively soft they do not easily break down the SiC paper. Thus initial grinding with 320 grit is generally sufficient for minimizing initial deformation and yet maintaining adequate removal rates. For
