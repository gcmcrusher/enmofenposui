## Power plant ashes as substitute raw materials 
The use of high-carbon fly ash in raw kiln feed has the additional benefit of saving fuel. For instance, in a wet-process plant, a fly ash containing 15% carbon and fed at 15% raw feed replacement will save around 150kCal/kg of clinker. In a dry process plant, at a 10% replacement level, it could save nearly 10% of the total fuel energy.

## Revealing the numbers behind calcined clay 
One of the great benefits of calcined clay is that it activates at a much lower temperature than that required to make clinker. With temperatures of 750 – 850˚C instead of 1400 – 1500˚C and much lower costs for grinding and handling, you gain significant fuel and power savings – 30% and 40%, respectively – when comparing the operating cost to make 1 tonne of clay versus 1
