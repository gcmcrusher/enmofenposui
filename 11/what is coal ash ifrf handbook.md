## Power plant ashes as substitute raw materials 
19.11.2012Hence, ash compositions vary over a wide range. Here, Dirk Lechtenbergy from MVW Lechtenberg presents an excerpt from the company's Alternative Fuels and Raw Materials Handbook. Ashes or coal combustion products (CCP) are categorised in groups, each based on physical and chemical forms derived from coal combustion methods and emission controls.

## Water Handbook 
With any type of fuel, corrosion and fouling potentials rapidly increase below gas temperatures of 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), which is the typical water dew point for flue gases. Cold-end corrosion and deposition are usually much less severe in coal-fired boilers than in oil-fired units.

SOURCE AND NATURE OF FIRESIDE DEPOSITION. Fireside fouling of combustion equipment is caused by the deposition of fuel ash components. Table 21-1 shows analyses of typical high, medium, and low ash liquid fuels. Oils containing more than 0.05% ash are considered high ash oils; those containing less than 0.02% ash are considered low ash oils.

## Coal blending 
Coal blending is the process of mixing coals after coal has been mined to achieve quality attributes that are desirable for the coal's intended application (e.g. steam generation, coking). The quality attributes that are most important in blending will differ from one mine site to another and also depend on how the coal seams vary in quality and their final intended use.
