## Improved grindability and gold liberation by microwave pretreatment of 
18.07.2013After microwave processing, the grindability of the ore was improved and the crushing strength and the Bond Work Index were reduced by 31˙2% and 18˙5%, respectively. In addition to the enhanced grindability, gold was released from the matrix of the host minerals at a coarser size, resulting in a significant increase in free gold recovery by gravity concentration.

## What is Microwave Digestion? 
Microwave digestion has become an increasingly popular method to dissolve metals as the digestion process can be completed in minutes, rather than the hours it takes with hot plate digestion. The success of this method is due to the high temperatures and pressures created by using microwaves. Also the complete sample is captive in the vessel so micro levels can be

## Iron ore pellet drying assisted by microwave: A kinetic evaluation
17/01/2018The complexity and energy consumption toward moisture removing, especially for highly hydrated iron ore, increased the need for breakthrough enhancements to this process. The present study has evaluated kinetics parameters of the moisture release from iron ore green pellet using energy transmitted through microwave (frequency of 2.45 GHz).

## Microwave Smelter : 8 Steps (with Pictures) 
To help focus the energy of the microwave I used silicon-carbide, which is a microwave susceptor: meaning it absorbs microwave energy and turns it into heat energy. Silicon-carbide can be found in block-knife sharpeners, but I found they were too expensive. Instead, I used a silicone-carbide rubbing stone for under $14 found at the hardware store.

Microwave-assisted synthesis. "Microwaves have the potential to become the bunsen burners of the 21st century"- Prof. C. Oliver Kappe, University of Graz, Austria. Compared to conventional reflux heating, microwave heating in modern reactors allows for increasing yields while significantly reducing reaction times down to a few minutes only.

## Basic Principles of Microwave Digestion 
Microwave digestion is a well-established preparation technique for converting solid samples into solutions suitable for analysis by ICP-AES, ICP-MS, atomic absorption spectrophotometry or polarography. The solid sample is chemically digested using a liquid reagent (usually a mineral acid) by microwave heating in a closed container.

## Industrial microwave generators 
The microwave generators are ideal to improve heating and drying processes. For the food industry, they allow food products to be quickly tempered or defrosted; but they can also be used in the industrial sector to heat or dry different kinds of materials (ceramics, wood, powder, textiles), for power-to-x and hydrogen synthesis, and for chemical processes such as
