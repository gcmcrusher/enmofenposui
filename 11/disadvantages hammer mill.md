## Hammermills and Roller Mills 
17/07/2020Hammermills accomplish size reduction by impacting a slow moving target, such as a cereal grain, with a rapidly moving hammer. The target has little or no momentum (low kinetic energy), whereas the hammer tip is travelling at a minimum of 16,000 feet per minute (4,880 m/min) and perhaps in excess of 23,000 feet per minute (7,015 m/min) (high kinetic energy).

melting substances should be chilled before milling. These are milled using hammer, colloid or fluid energy mill. Melting point - Waxy substances, fats and oils are softened during size reduction due to heat generated. This is avoided by cooling the mill and the substance. Hygroscopic - Certain substances absorb moisture content rapidly.
