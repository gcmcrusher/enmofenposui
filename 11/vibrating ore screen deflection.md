## Circle
Static deflection corresponds to this frequency. Vibration isolation is a control principle employed to mitigate transmission. On circle-throw vibrating screens, passive vibration isolation in the form of mechanical springs and suspension are employed at the base of the unit, which provides stability and control of motor vibration.

20.06.2016Screening capacity can be described by the following formula with factors specified below: Qu = A x B x C x D x E x F x G x H x J x K x L x Af, where: Qu = Screening capacity. [t/h] (passing through) A = Nominal capacity [ (m/h)/m] (passing through) B = Oversize factor. C = Halfsize factor. D = Deck location factor.
