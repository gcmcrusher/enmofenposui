Definition: Aggregate is a granular material used in concrete and mortar.It usually comes from natural river sand and river pebbles, or from crushed natural rocks. Such as sand, crushed stone and gravel. It is one of the main components of concrete and acts as a filler for concrete, not only giving them quality, but also providing strength and durability.

27/07/2021Aggregate crushing was carried out in a Los Angeles drum, in accordance with the requirements of EN 1097-2:2020. The analysis showed that for grits of the 10–14 mm fraction, the lower values of the LA indices were obtained, which allows for obtaining a bigger index of crushing strength than in the case of crushing using the 4–8 mm fraction

Aggregate Crushing Test. The crushing strength of aggregate was calculated by adopting the procedures as standardized in IS:2386 part IV. In a cylindrical measure of 11.5 cm diameter 18 cm height the dry aggregate passing through 12.5mm size sieve retained in 10mm size sieve was filled in three layers.

Aggregate Crushing value depends on the shape of agg also. Angular aggregates have a lower ACV, than Irregular or rounded aggregates.If we cut a core out of the same agg (Say in the quarry) and test for compressive strength, will give a higher MPa value. It can be considered as a concrete cylinder or UCS tested in lab. So it is hard to corelate
