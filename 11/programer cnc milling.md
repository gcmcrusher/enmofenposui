When I started programming for simple 3 axis mills, I was making about $22 an hour. As I moved on to 4 axis horizontals, and started programming more complex parts, my salary increased. I only have three years experience programming, but I'm the main mill programmer at the shop I work at, and probably push out roughly 8-10 prototype parts a week.
