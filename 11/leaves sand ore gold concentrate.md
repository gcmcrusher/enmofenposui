## Miners Terminology 
Concentrates - Or Con's is the concentrated material retrieved from a sluice box containing mostly black sand and heavier materials. Dredging - Dredging is the mining of placer gravel's to beneath local water levels employing mechanical excavation and a floating plant. The material is sucked from the riverbed with a gas vacuum and circulated through a floating seclude box.

Such ores are referred to as refractory, and they frequently contain the sulfide minerals pyrite, pyrrhotite, or arsenopyrite. Gold can be freed from these ores or concentrates by treating them with various oxidizing processes. The most common method is to roast gold-bearing minerals at temperatures of 450 to 750 C (840 to 1,380 F) to

Gold dissolves in aqua regia, a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids, and in sodium or potassium cyanide. The latter solvent is the basis for the cyanide process that is used to recover gold from low-grade ore. The degree of purity of native gold, bullion (bars or ingots of unrefined gold), and refined gold is stated in terms of gold content.
