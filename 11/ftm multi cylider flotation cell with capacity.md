## Introduction Of A New Generation Of Induced Gas Flotation
27.04.2003Flotation machines were originally developed as devices for removing suspended solids in the mining and mineral industries. By the 1960s, economic considerations triggered modifications to flotation methods which resulted in the development of large multi cell units with dissolved gas capacities of up to 3000 cu. ft. capacity per cell 1.
