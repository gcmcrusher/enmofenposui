## Calculation of the bearing force for belt drives 
02/09/2018Calculation of bearing force. The forces acting in the belt press the belt onto the pulley and thus also act on the shaft bearings. The tight side force and the slack side force is thus balanced by the bearing force of the shaft. By the law of cosines, this bearing force F b can be determined from the tight side force F t and the slack side

Belt Conveyor Load Calculations. When carrying out belt conveyor load calculation, the total payload on the belt conveyor as well as the area the load will take up on the conveyor need to be considered. Most belt conveyors are designed with the belt being dragged over a stainless steel deck. This causes friction between the belt and the deck.

Belt Load. Gather the proper belt load calculation to prevent applying too much pressure to your conveyor belt system. When the load is per square foot: P = G1 x C (in feet) x W (in feet) When the load is pounds per hour: P = G2 / (S x 60) x C (in feet) Horsepower. Level conveyors: HP = F x S x (P + M) / 33,000
