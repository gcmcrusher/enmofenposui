Today's commercial dry-feed gasification systems are limited to processing pressures of about 450 psi. Pratt Whitney Rocketdyne's feed pump more than doubles those pressures to 1,000 psi. Higher system pressures mean higher system efficiencies; higher efficiencies translate into less coal used to produce power and other products.

## Some U.S. electricity generating plants use dry cooling
29.08.2018Dry cooling systems tend to be more economical for natural gas combined-cycle plants because the amount of cooling needed is much less per megawatthour than for coal or nuclear plants. More than 15% of operating generating capacity from natural gas combined-cycle plants in the United States use dry cooling technology. In the past five years (2013–2017),

Supercritical Power Plant: Supercritical plants are coal powered power plants that can sustain temperatures of 550šC to 590šC and transfer up to 40% of the coals energy into power. This technology has only come into use in recent years. Most new coal-fired power plants built in the West are supercritical.

10.04.2019Clean coal is an energy that can generally be used as fuel, the fine coal of bituminous coal is generally used for coking. The main reasons of washing coal are as bellow: 1. Improve coal quality and reduce emissions of coal-fired pollutants. Coal washing can remove 50%-80% of ash and 30%-40% of total sulfur (or 60%~80% of inorganic sulfur) in coal.
