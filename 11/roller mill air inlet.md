Within 20 seconds of entering the pellet mill, feed goes from an air-dry (about 10-12 percent moisture) condition at ambient temperature, to 15-16 percent moisture at 80-90C. During subsequent compression and extrusion through holes in a ring' die, friction further increases feed temperature to nearly 92C.

## How Cooling Towers Work (W/ Diagram, Pictures Principles) 
Cooling towers are a special type of heat exchanger that allows water and air to come in contact with each other to lower the temperature of the hot water. During this process, small volumes of water evaporate, lowering the temperature of the water that's being circulated throughout the cooling tower. In a short summary, a cooling tower cools

## MILK AND WHEY POWDER 
Powder production is carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the pre-treated milk is evaporated to a dry matter content of typically 48 – 52 %. Whey is concentrated to a dry matter content of 58 – 62 %. In the second phase, the concentrate is turned into powder in a spray dryer.

well as the Cement production. Also the feed materials which are coming from roller press to the ball mill are powdery form instead of Clinker material. The feed chute for this application requires more area to direct the material and more air allowing area to achieve the required air flow inside the mill to transmit the grounded material.
