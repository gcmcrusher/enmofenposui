For the vast majority of ounces of gold produced, comminution costs in the form of power, grinding media, and liners represent the single largest cost category of milling. Since, semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) ball-mill circuits represent the single largest type of gold milling comminution circuits, the

## Comminution 
Comminution: Comminution utilises energy to reduce the size of ore particles in order to liberate embedded mineral grains so that they can be recovered in the subsequent process stages. The research under this theme focusses on understanding how energy is used in devices that use different breakage mechanisms to achieve size reduction and how energy is utilised
