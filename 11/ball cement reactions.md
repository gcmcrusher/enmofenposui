10.03.2022Cement's lack of sustainability is well known. When producing clinker – a precursor to cement – the calcining process converts calcium carbonate to calcium oxide, releasing carbon dioxide. In addition, the reaction itself takes place at close to 1,400C, which involves burning large quantities of fossil fuel.

## Understanding Limestone in Cement 
26.03.2015The limestone acts as a seed crystal for the cement, better distributing the reaction products and increasing the reactivity of the cement. As there is always unhydrated cement in the concrete, this change will have no real measurable effect on the use of fly ash. The cement might have a reduced water demand, and the coarser cement gradation

15.01.2018Primary cementing. The objective of primary cementing is to provide zonal isolation. Cementing is the process of mixing a slurry of cement, cement additives and water and pumping it down through casing to critical points in the annulus around the casing or in the open hole below the casing string. The two principal functions of the cementing
