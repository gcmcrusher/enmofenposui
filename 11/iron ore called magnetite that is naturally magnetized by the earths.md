## magnetite is a natural magnet 
Natural The abrasive known as "emery" is a natural mixture of magnetite and corundum. This iron oxide mineral, also known as lodestone (translated as 'course stone'), was once used as a primitive compass, as it can be found naturally magnetised. Some forms of Magnetite from specific localities are in fact themselves magnets. 2019 Aug 1

## What Are Magnets Made From 
The iron ore magnetite also known as lodestone is a natural permanent magnet. Other permanent magnets can be made by subjecting certain materials to a magnetic force. When the force is removed these materials retain their own magnetic properties. They are made by surrounding certain materials with a coil of wire.

## Iron and Magnets 
25.01.2013Lodestones are made of an iron ore called magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), the only naturally occurring material that exhibits significant magnetism. By the 12 th century, it was known that lodestones carried two points of maximum attraction, called poles, and that these poles aligned with certain directions on the Earth.

## Why is lodestone magnetic?
The leading theory is that lodestones are magnetized by the strong magnetic fields surrounding lightning bolts. Lodestone and other magnetic iron ores often occur in igneous and metamorphic rocks found around the world. (also called Magnetite) is a naturally-occurring permanent magnet mineral.

28.04.2022By conducting a Red Streak Test. It is a simple way to determine if you have Hematite on your hands. The uniqueness of this iron ore is that it is red or silver, which always produces a red streak. If you think it is Hematite, you should consider that it could be magnetite if you do not see red when you do this test.

05.10.2016Magnetite. Limonite. Siderite. The iron minerals that are at present used as ores are hematite, magnetite, limonite, and siderite; also, occasionally ankerite, goethite, and turgite. Hematite is the most important iron ore. The iron content of the pure minerals is as follows: Ankerite is a carbonate of lime, magnesia, manganese, and iron.

27.02.2020Magnetite is a rock mineral and, along with hematite, is mined as one of the main iron ores. Can magnet attract iron your blood? A molecule called hemoglobin in the red blood cells contains iron. Because if magnets do attract blood, we must be careful of the magnets around us! Fortunately, the iron in our blood isn't attracted to magnets.

## Magnetite Meaning and Properties 
Naturally-magnetized pieces of magnetite, called lodestone, will attract small pieces of iron, which is how ancient peoples first discovered the property of magnetism. Magnetite is a heavy material, black or brownish-black with a metallic luster. It is the most magnetic of all natural commonly occurring minerals on the Earth.
