Minerals form when rocks are heated enough that atoms of different elements can move around and join into different molecules.Minerals are deposited from salty water solutions on Earth's surface and underground. What causes gold ore formation? Gold-laden water heated by magma-molten rock-in Earth's shallow crust forms a variety of lode gold deposits.
