## Ziegler
As you can see, the Ziegler-Nichols open-loop tuning method relies heavily on dead time (L) as a descriptive parameter for the process. This may be problematic in processes having insubstantial dead time, as the small L values obtained during the open-loop test will predict large controller gain (Kp) and aggressive integral (τi) time constant

What is Loop. Loop is an app you build and load on an iPhone (or iPod). You enter your personal therapy settings (e.g., carbohydrate ratio, basal rates, insulin sensitivity) Loop uses this information, your insulin on board ( IOB) and glucose data, to determine how much insulin you need to bring your blood glucose within the target range you set.

17.09.2021A closed circuit allows current to flow, but an open circuit leaves electrons stranded. Picture a gallon of water flowing through an open pipe. The water will flow for a short time but then stop when all the water exits the pipe. If you pump water through a closed pipe system, the water will continue to flow as long as you keep forcing it to move.

23.09.2020The design of closed loop control systems is comparatively more complex than open ones. Such system takes feedback from outut and performs the required action accordingly. The entire construction requires a sensor for taking input, some sort of controller which performs the action and a feedback taken from the output.

## Water Handbook 
In a closed system, water circulates in a closed cycle and is subjected to alternate cooling and heating without air contact. Heat, absorbed by the water in the closed system, is normally transferred by a water-to-water exchanger to the recirculating water of an open recirculating system, from which the heat is lost to atmosphere (Figure 32-1).
