## Extraction of Value
In this process, the first step was the thermal reduction of the gypsum waste into calcium sulfide (CaS), followed by its direct aqueous carbonation, yielding low-grade carbonate products (i.e., 99 mass% as CaCO 3) or precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). The carbonate product was found to be predominantly composed of calcite (99.5%) with only 0.5% quartz. Calcite was the
