## Material Fatigue Strength 
23/07/2020Let's take a look at how proper design can improve the life expectancy of materials. 1. Designed within the endurance limit. The maximum cyclic load that will be applied during service must be within the endurance limit to prevent fatigue failure. 2. Fault-tolerant design. The design must account for the failure of parts.

They gave us some insight on how exhaust sizing and design can affect performance. Tuning an exhaust system to a given application is a case-by-case basis challenge. The displacement, exhaust valve size, induction system, cam profile, exhaust port design and RPM range all factor into deciding what form the exhaust system should take.

There are numerous methods for fabricating composite components. Some methods have been borrowed (injection molding from the plastic industry, for example), but many were developed to meet specific design or manufacturing challenges faced with fiber-reinforced polymers. Selection of a method for a particular part, therefore, will depend on the materials,
