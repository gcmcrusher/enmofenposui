## Definition of Hongxing Ore processing_
Ore processing or ore dressing process. 1. Ore crushing. Ore crushing means that using crushing equipments crush mine stone or rock into small size. In common, ore crushing methods are crushed and broken, shatter. Crushing can be divided into three sections: primary crush, secondary crush and tertiary crush.

## Iron Beneficiation 
Beneficiation is the process of increasing the concentration of a valuable component of an ore. Native iron particles exist in lunar soil in fairly large quantities. They come from nickel-iron meteorites, which become pulverized upon impact.These iron particles are tiny (fine grained) and well mixed into the fine dust of the lunar regolith.As they are in a metallic state and strongly
