01.09.2019In soils, Cd occurs at concentrations of 0.01 to 1 mg/kg with a worldwide mean of 0.36 mg/kg. Weathering can lead to Cd concentrations up to 5 μg/L in soil water and up to 1 μg/L in groundwater. In aqueous solutions, Cd generally occurs as the divalent Cd 2+ and it is mobilized mainly in oxic, acidic conditions.
