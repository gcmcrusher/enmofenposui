## Magnetite 
Magnetite is widely distributed usually with octahedral or spherical morphology in igneous and metamorphic rocks. Magnetite is also found in limestones, in fumarolic deposits, and in living forms. For the latter, the mineral plays some very important role, which we highlight in Sections 10.4.3.3.2 and 10.4.3.3.3. Black magnetite, with a

## Confirmed: Magnetite's iron ore is 'very high quality'
Magnetite has received a massive leg up after interim metallurgical testwork confirmed the ability of its flowsheet to produce a very high-quality iron ore concentrate. The ability to produce concentrates exceeding the design specification of 67.5% iron and 4.5% silica+alumina – with one sample producing 69.7% iron and 2.5% silica+alumina

## Prevent Magnetite From Plugging Your Steam And Water System
Magnetite is a form of iron particulate that naturally forms on the inside of steam and water pipes. In many aging power plants during plant startup and cycling, particles of the coating can shed – known as a crud burst or iron throw.These magnetite particles can cause issues and damage within the plant's steam and water analysis system (SWAS) by jamming and plugging sample

## Magnetite Applications and Uses 
Magnetite outperformed a soluble Fe 2+ catalyst at removing between 80 and 90% of crude oil residues from soil in one week, compared to just 10-15% for the regular iron catalyst(13). The use of magnetite fertilizer as a soil contamination reliever is particularly welcomed owing to magnetite's relatively low toxic nature.
