Copper mining costs are being reported ranging from around $2/pound to a high of $3.20 per pound. As China's economy cools to a 5% growth rate, they require fewer resources, such as steel and copper, so the demand weakens, but if American and European economies ever recover, copper will again rise to the $4 per pound level.

## How to Write a Mining Industry Business Proposal
The price of minerals is up all over the world, and mining is a growth business right now. Maybe you want approval from a government agency to open a new mining operation. Maybe you want to expand an existing operation or revive an old one. Perhaps you hope to interest investors in a mining project, sell equipment and machinery, or sell

## Mine 2018 
For the world's Top 40 miners, 2017 was a remarkable year. Thanks in large measure to the continuing recovery in commodity prices, fuelled by general economic growth, revenues rose dramatically by 23 per cent. At the same time, the cost-saving strategies of the past few years delivered, with margins and cash-generating ability improved as well,

01.02.2014Effects of mine and mineral type were observed, with underground milling costs being significantly less than open pit milling costs and gold mines occupying a significantly larger share of mine operating costs than copper-containing mines. The overall relative operating costs were found to be in the ratios between (43:43:14) and (45:45:10) (Mine:Mill:G A). A

The cost of closing a mine depends on the age, location, type, and size of mine, amount of waste, geological characteristics, and type of mineral being extracted. For example, a medium-sized open-pit mine that is 10-15 years old could cost a few million dollars to close, while a large open-pit mine that has been operating for more than 35 years
