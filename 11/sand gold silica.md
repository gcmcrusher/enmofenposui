## getting gold out of silica sand
Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). The most common form of SiO2 is quartz – a chemically inert and relatively hard mineral. SiO2 grades at a 7 out of 10 on Mohs hardness scale, making it

## What Is Silica Sand How Is It Different From Regular 
The colour of each sand deposit depends largely on the variety of minerals and rock detritus that make up the resource. In order to be considered a silica sand the material must contain at least 95% SiO2 and less than 0.6% iron oxide. If the sand does not meet this criteria, it will qualify as what's often called 'regular' sand.

To make calcium silicate bricks, silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand–lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170C (340F) for several hours. Some gel, similar to the calcium silicate hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement, is formed, and this bonds the sand particles together.

## Silica – the Most Abundant Element in Sand and Soil
After oxygen, silica is the most abundant element in sand and soil, and is found mostly as silicon dioxide. In the soil, it helps seeds to germinate by breaking through their hard outer shell and, if soil lacks silica, very few seeds would sprout naturally. In biodynamics it is recognised as an essential mineral and is added to composts.
