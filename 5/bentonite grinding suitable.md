## Properties 
Bentonite vitrification temperature is higher than other clays. Therefore, when used as an additive, it makes green sand more durable, and, in particular, more resistant to heat stress. Surface properties (coagulation– absorption – adsorption) Bentonite absorption – adsorption properties are determined by the high specific surface and free charges present on each micelle.
