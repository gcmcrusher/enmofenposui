## Granite vs Marble 
They are natural stones — unlike, say, engineered quartz silestone — so both marble and granite surfaces are susceptible to chipping and staining. However, granite is more durable than marble and less prone to stains and scratching. For this reason, granite is often found in kitchens, while marble is more common in other areas, like bathrooms.
