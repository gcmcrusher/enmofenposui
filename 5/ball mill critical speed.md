## What precisely is a ball mill? 
Feb 25, 2022The critical speed must be attained for a ball mill to function well. The speed at which the balls in the mill begin to rotate along the inner walls of the mill is referred to as critical speed. If the critical speed of a ball mill is not reached, the balls will remain stationary at the bottom, which results in little or no impact on the material.

Aug 15, 2012Critical speed is the rpm at which the media will be stuck to the side of the jar based on centripetal force. All of the values in the formula are to be used in inches. I'm not sure how the 265.45 value is derived, but it is based upon inches. Critical speed = 265.45 / sqrt (jar ID - media diameter)
