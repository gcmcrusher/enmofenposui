30/01/2017 High-performance SiO x was scalable synthesized by means of simple high-energy ball-milling method, and used as anode materials for lithium ion batteries. The electrochemical performance of SiO x electrode after high-energy ball-milling is improved effectively compared to raw SiO x.That is benefit for the reduced size of SiO x powder.
