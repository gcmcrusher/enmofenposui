Noise ordinances by city state: This list of noise ordinances for the 500 largest US cities will be used to construct a model noise ordinance. Within each of the pdf files, we have highlighted the relevant passages from each ordinance that indicate regulations for combatting noise. 5 different colors were used to indicate the different kinds

## Sound Level Meter / Noise Level Meter 
The Sound Level Meter / Noise Level Meter PCE-MSL 1 is a simple sound measuring device. The PCE-MSL 1 sound level meter / noise level meter is used to quickly determine the ambient noise level. In addition to the volume measurement, the PCE-MSL 1 sound level meter / noise level meter also has the option of determining the ambient temperature.

## Reducing Noise Seven Different Ways 
5. Use masking sound. In some cases it is easiest to hide the offending noise, or "sweep it under the rug.". Masking sound can be added to a room to raise the background noise level and cover up bothersome sources. This is commonly done in open office space to reduce distractions and improve speech privacy. 6.

## What Noises Cause Hearing Loss? 
Common Sources of Noise and Decibel Levels. Sound is measured in decibels (dB). A whisper is about 30 dB, normal conversation is about 60 dB, and a motorcycle engine running is about 95 dB. Noise above 70 dB over a prolonged period of time may start to damage your hearing. Loud noise above 120 dB can cause immediate harm to your ears. The table below shows dB

If the equivalent sound level goes up by 3 dBA, the allowable exposure time is cut in half, to 4 hours. At 100 dBA the allowable exposure time is only 15 minutes per 8 hour workday, though we recommend no exposure to those levels without protective measures ( e.g. sound baffles or hearing protection devices).

## Sound Power 
Sound Power (W) Sound power is the energy rate, or energy of sound per unit of time ( J/s or W in SI-units) - emitted by a source. When sound propagates through a medium acoustic sound power is transferred. The sound intensity is the sound power transmission through a surface (W/m2) - a vector quantity with direction through a surface.
