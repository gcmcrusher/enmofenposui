Mining Zircon sand is mined in two ways: dry mining (the above-described inland deposits) and wet mining (using dredges) along the coastlines (ZIA 2015). Dry mining is the most commonly used method that can be applied to hard ground deposits, discontinuous deposits and small tonnage high-grade deposits. Traditional earthmoving equipment
