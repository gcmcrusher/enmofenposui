Answer = 10 x 10 x 1 = 100 ft 3. Please note that all measurements should be in same units. Finally to calculate the weight of gravel required, multiply the volume with the density of the material. Let's assume that the density of the material is 47.5723 kg/ft3. Weight of gravel required should be 47.5723 x 100 = 4757.23 kg

## Bearing Capacity of Soil 
The bearing capacity of your soil will help you determine if you need a shallow foundation or deep foundation. Soil strength directly under the footing, where loads are concentrated, is crucial to foundation performance. You can get a pretty good idea of the soil bearing capacity in the trench bottom using a hand penetrometer.
