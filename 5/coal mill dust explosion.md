Even when a mill is shut down routinely, there is a danger that any residual coal left within the mill will oxidise, which can explode as the mill is restarted.

## Coal Silo Explosion Vent Design 
07.03.2007Dust explosions involving raw coal bins are not common. Generally explosion protection is applied after the mill as the source of ignition - the mill - and the dust load in the system are at hazardeous levels. The raw coal bin is more likely to have a fire or a smouldering event and thus other protection systems may be more applicable than explosion venting.
