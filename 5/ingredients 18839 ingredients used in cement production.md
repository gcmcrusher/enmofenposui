## High strength concrete properties, admixture, and mix design
Till the late 1970s, the use of concrete in excess of M40 in tall buildings was not known. Now, with the effective use of admixtures and other sophisticated applications of concrete technology, it is easy to achieve a strength of 50 MPa in 12 to 18 hours, and above 70 MPa at 28-days.. It is feasible to produce concrete having a compressive strength of up to 150 MPa at 91-days.

## The cement that absorbs carbon dioxide 
Concrete that is exposed to the air naturally undergoes carbonation, a process where carbon dioxide is slowly reabsorbed into concrete's structure and reacts with the calcium hydroxide found there to form calcium carbonate. This locks CO 2 away, providing a stable long-term storage solution. The process can even boost concrete strength by

## Water is an important ingredient of concrete
Thus, water and its quality (and also its quantity) plays an important role in determining the quality of concrete. Strength and durability of concrete is to a large extent determined by its water to cementitious materials ratio. Water is required to wet the surface of aggregates to develop adhesive quality as the cement paste binds quickly and
