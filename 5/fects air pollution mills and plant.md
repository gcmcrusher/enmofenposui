## Project Report on Air Pollution
Project Report # 4. Major Air Pollutants that Affects Environment: Some of the major air pollutants that pollutes the environment are: i. Sulphur Dioxide (SO 2): . Sulphur dioxide (SO 2) is a colourless gas with a pungent, suffocating odour.SO 2 is corrosive to organic materials and it irritates the eyes, nose and lungs; therefore it is quite dangerous air pollutants.

Air pollution harms human health and the environment. In Europe, emissions of many air pollutants have decreased substantially over the past decades, resulting in improved air quality across the region. However, air pollutant concentrations are still too high, and air quality problems persist. A significant proportion of Europe's population live in areas,

Air pollution refers to substances in the air that harm human health, welfare, plant or animal life. Most pollution in London is caused by road transport and domestic and commercial heating systems. The UK Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010 sets standards for a number of pollutants than can harm human health and the environment.
