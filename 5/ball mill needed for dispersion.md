The necessary energy for dispersion and grinding is transmitted to the grinding beads by the agitator discs. The mill is fed continuously by the pump. The time spent by the material inside the chamber is controlled by variation of the pump speed. The retention of the grinding beads inside the chamber is achieved by means of a cartridge.
