Score: 4.1/5 (60 votes) . In terms of the ratio for concrete, it depends on what strength you are trying to achieve, but as a general guide a standard concrete mix would be 1 part cement to 2 parts sand to 4 parts aggregates.For foundations, a mix of 1 part cement to 3 parts sand to 6 parts aggregates can be used.

## How do I calculate how much sand, cement and water I need for 
A concrete mixture ratio of 1 part cement, 3 parts sand, and 3 parts aggregate will produce a concrete mix of approximately 3000 psi. Typically you slowly mix in water until the concrete is workable. Too much water weakens the resulting concrete and makes finishing more difficult. Share. Improve this answer. Follow edited Jul 27, 2016 at 19

05.08.2022Concrete mixing ratios can be adjusted according to what you're using the concrete for. A simple but good concrete mix design is 1 part cement to 2 parts sand to 3 parts stone mixed with as little water an necessary to get the workable mix you need. See my concrete mixing ratios for 3000 and 4000 psi concrete mix designs.

Manufacturers rate the size of tilting-drum concrete mixers by the volume of the mixer drum. A 6-cubic-foot cement mixer holds 6 cubic feet of material if positioned upright and filled to the brim. The maximum working capacity of the mixer falls far short of that. Six-cubic-foot mixers can mix only 3.5 cubic feet of material or less.
