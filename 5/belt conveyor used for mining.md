## When Were Conveyor Belts Invented? 
The next major innovation was the underground conveyor belt, which mining engineer Richard Sutcliffe invented and patented in 1905. While conveyor belts already had applications in the mining industry, they weren't yet used underground. They needed some adaptations to survive the harsh environments and operate in confined spaces.

## What Is a Trough Belt Conveyor and Why You Should Use One
Trough Belt Conveyors. A troughed belt is one of the most commonly used conveyors in industrial and mining practices. It gets its name from the trough-shaped idlers that sit underneath the flat belt. The curved shape of the idlers means that the materials traveling on the conveyor are less likely to fall off the track and be damaged, destroyed

## Mining guide: Conveyor belt monitoring and control in mines
19/12/2018One of the most important aspects of a successful mining operation is the effectiveness of a project's conveyor belts, transporting material too bulky and heavy to be carried by hand to where it needs to be, and functioning in a safe manner. Faulty conveyor belts have been reported to be responsible for up t 50% of unscheduled disruptions.
