## Ball Consumption In Sag Mill 
Modelling SAG milling power and specific energy. The ball charge is a function of the bulk fraction of the SAG mill volume (Jb) occupied by balls; the ore retained in the mill is the result of the volumetric filling which depends on the ore size distribution (specially the % +6″ and the % −6″ +1″), on the rotational speed (N/Nc) and on the solid concentration by weight

12.05.2018Grinding Ball Example. The SAG Mill will process 1 Diamond Ore at the cost of 3,600 I. It will produce 2 Diamonds, has a 25% chance of producing an auxiliary Diamond, a 15% chance of producing Cobblestone, and a 5% chance of producing Coal Powder. If you use a Dark Steel Ball, then the recipe only needs 70% of the base power, down to 2,520 I.
