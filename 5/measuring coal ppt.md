## Evaporation from coal mine pit lakes: measurements and modelling
Abstract: Open cut coal mines can have large surface water catchments and often extend to depths below the natural water table level with constant dewatering required to maintain coal extraction. When mining ceases, surface water runoff and groundwater start to fill the void, and pit lakes form. Understanding the hydrological and chemical evolution of these lakes is important

Another way to characterize coals is to determine the thermal energy released when the coal is burned. We have already introduced the concept of heating value, and the range of these values for coals (see Chapter 6). We can also measure other characteristics of coals that help predict how coals will behave when handled and burned. This series

The heat rate of coal-fired electricity generating units (EGUs) is the amount of energy required to generate each kilowatt -hour (kWh) of electricity. The more efficient ly an EGU convert s the energy embedded in coal into electricity, the lower the EGU's heat rate and, correspondingly, the lower its CO. 2. intensity (CO. 2. lb/kWh).

## Parts
In science and engineering, the parts-per notation is a set of pseudo-units to describe small values of miscellaneous dimensionless quantities, e.g. mole fraction or mass fraction.Since these fractions are quantity-per-quantity measures, they are pure numbers with no associated units of measurement.Commonly used are parts-per-million (ppm, 10 −6), parts-per-billion (ppb, 10

## What are the types of coal? 
There are four major types (or "ranks") of coal. Rank refers to steps in a slow, natural process called "coalification," during which buried plant matter changes into an ever denser, drier, more carbon-rich, and harder material. The four ranks are: Anthracite: The highest rank of coal. It is a hard, brittle, and black lustrous coal, often referred to as hard coal, containing a high

## Estimates of Emissions from Coal Fired Thermal Power Plants in India
There is a need to modernize India's thermal power plants and reduce the coal usage per unit of electricity generation (kg/kWh). Modernization with reduction in coal usage (kg/kWh) will help in reducing the national emissions. Quality of Indian coal will remain same but with the improvement in combustion technologies, emissions can be reduced.

Etymology. The word originally took the form col in Old English, from Proto-Germanic kula(n), which in turn is hypothesized to come from the Proto-Indo-European root g(e)u-lo-live coal. Germanic cognates include the Old Frisian kole, Middle Dutch cole, Dutch kool, Old High German chol, German Kohle and Old Norse kol, and the Irish word gual is also a cognate via the Indo
