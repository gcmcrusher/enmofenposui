22.04.2022Crushed Stone #1: Approx. 2″-4″ Wide. Crushed stone grade no. 1 is the largest size with diameters ranging from around 2 inches to 4 inches. As this grade contains larger pieces, it's not suitable for shoveling and stones will need to be moved individually. Typical uses for gravel #1 include: Filling larger holes.

If a rock contains clay minerals, then an extra conduction pathway is possible via the electrical double layer that forms at the interface of the clay mineral and the water. This effectively allows ions to move through the system with a lower effective viscosity (higher mobility) than in the liquid phase. More about this in Geophysics 424.
