Although stoker systems and fluidized-bed combustion units use relatively coarse-crushed coal, most coal combustion at the present time takes place in pulverized-fuel boilers. One of the objectives of the pulverizer coal in such systems is to reduce the coal particle size so that 70–80% passes through a 200 mesh (75 μm) screen (summary after Scott, 1995).
