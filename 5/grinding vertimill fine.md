15.03.2015The mining industry often needs to grind particles as fine as 7 μm to liberate valuable minerals locked in the gangue minerals (Glencore, 2015). Ball mills have been used previously for fine grinding applications but stirred mills require approximately 30–50% lower energy for coarser fine grinding or ultra-fine grinding (Palaniandy et al

## Fine Grinding 
Fine grinding is often conducted to regrind a rougher flotation concentrate prior to cleaning. As the concentrate is not the same composition as the ore ground in earlier comminution stages, it must be considered in isolation from the primary and secondary grinding circuits. The two-parameter procedure used in the laboratory is usually impractical in an operating plant
