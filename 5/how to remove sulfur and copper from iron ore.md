Nickel concentrates may be leached with sulfuric acid or ammonia, or they may be dried and smelted in flash and bath processes, as is the case with copper. Nickel requires higher smelting temperatures (in the range of 1,350 C [2,460 F]) in order to produce an artificial nickel-iron sulfide known as matte, which contains 25 to 45 percent nickel.In the next step, iron in the

## Your question: How does removal of Sulphur from coal reduce air 
Sulfur dioxide, SO2, is a colorless gas or liquid with a strong, choking odor. It is produced from the burning of fossil fuels (coal and oil) and the smelting of mineral ores (aluminum, copper, zinc, lead, and iron) that contain sulfur. What is the cleanest burning fossil fuel? Natural gas is a relatively clean burning fossil fuel
