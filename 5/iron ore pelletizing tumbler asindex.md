## The iron ore importance in Direct Reduction
The most suitable particle size of iron ores to be processed in the HYL reactor is in the range of +6 mm and -16 mm. a) Large particles present higher resistance for reduction. b) Small particles tend to increase the pressure-drop (∆P). Reducibility The reducibility of the iron ores depends mainly on: a) Particle ore porosity. b) Particle size.
