## How is Salt Extracted from the Sea? 
Evaporaton Ponds. The process for extracting salt from sea water is an ancient technology and involves evaporation ponds. Shallow, water-proof ponds are dug out and connected to the sea by means of a short canal. A broad area and shallow depth allow a given volume of water to absorb more sunlight. The pond is flooded, and then the canal is closed.

## Magnesium: extraction
Step 2： The next step is reduction of the magnesium oxide. The reducing agent is ferrosilicon (an alloy of iron and silicon) which is made by heating sand with coke and scraps iron, and typically contains about 80% silicon. Step 3： The oxides are mixed with crushed ferrosilicon, and made into briquettes for loading into the reactor.

## What is the difference between a rock and a mineral?
Common minerals include quartz, feldspar, mica, amphibole, olivine, and calcite. A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals, or a body of undifferentiated mineral matter. Common rocks include granite, basalt, limestone, and sandstone. USGS Mineral Resources Online Spatial Data (mineral resources data/maps)

01.12.20091.. IntroductionIn this paper we examine in detail the production of 36 Cl in calcareous rocks (limestones, and dolomites). 36 Cl is uniquely valuable in geologic studies, because it can be extracted and measured in nearly every rock type. 36 Cl is the only cosmogenic nuclide suitable for limestones and dolomites.

## What are Mineral Rights? 
22.03.2022The mineral rights give the owner permission to use the surface of the land to access the minerals for exploration and production. Though penalties could be levied, and the mineral rights can even be withdrawn if the miner contravenes the surface damage agreement stipulating what types of activities are permissible.

Quicklime is obtained by 'burning' or heating calcium carbonate, which occurs in natural limestone deposits. This process is one of the oldest chemical operations discovered by man, being used all over the world. In India, for example, quicklime was used for waterproofing boats, while in ancient Greece, it was used as a ingredient of the
