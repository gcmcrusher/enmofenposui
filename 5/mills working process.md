30.05.2013Fig 4 Roll configurations in rolling mills. Two-high mill roll configuration – This is the most commonly used rolling mill configuration. In this configuration, there are two horizontally mounted rolls. The rolling mill motor drives either both rolls (top and bottom) or only one roll (normally the bottom roll) with the top roll rotating due to the friction between the roll and the

## Rolling 
Hot rolling is a metalworking process that occurs above the recrystallization temperature of the material. After the grains deform during processing, they recrystallize, which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening. The starting material is usually large pieces of metal, like semi-finished casting

The working principle is simple; The milling time increases with a decrease in the specific energy of the mill. Thus, a process that takes only a few minutes in a planetary mill can take hours in attritors and several days in commercial tumbling ball mills. Commercial batch NETZSCH attritors (Fig. 3.12) used industrially today are available in sizes from 115 to 720 L

## What is The Flour Mill Operation Process
To understand the flour mill operation, which is the process by which grains get ground up into flour, we need to understand how the process occurs. In this flour milling process, different machinery including separators, sifters and purifiers are used. A flourmill contains all the sections necessary to convert grain into flour.

## How Does a Hammer Mill Work?
Hammer mills work on the principle that most materials will crush, shatter or pulverize upon impact: The Process: • Material is fed into the mill's chamber through the . feed chute, typically by gravity. • The material is struck by . ganged hammers (generally rectangular pieces of hardened steel) which are attached to a . shaft. that rotates at high speed inside the mill's .
