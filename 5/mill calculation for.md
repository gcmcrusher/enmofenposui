## Milling Horsepower Calculator 
Milling Horsepower Calculator. Calculate the horsepower required for a milling operation based on the feed rate and depth of cut, which are used to determine the material removal rate (or metal removal rate). Also required is the unit power, which is a material property describing the amount of power required to cut that material.

## Mill Levy/Rate 
The mill levy/rate is a form of a property tax that is based on a property's assessed value. The mill levy's traditionally been, and continues to be, expressed in "mills.". A mill is equal to $1 for each $1,000 in assessed property value (derived from the Latin word "mil," meaning 1,000). The mill levy is calculated by determining

Calculation For Speed Of Ball Mill Of 21 Rpm Ball Mill. Calculations: the critical speed of ball mill is given by, where r = radius of ball mill; r = radius of ball. for r = 1000 mm and r = 50 mm, n c = 30.7 rpm. but the mill is operated at a speed of 15 rpm. therefore, the mill is operated at 100 x 15/30.7 = 48.86 % of critical speed.
