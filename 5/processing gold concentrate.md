## Bacterial Oxidation of Refractory Gold Concentrates
Many refractory gold concentrates have high arsenic contents, and there is an increasing demand for treating such concentrates using bio-oxidation. As the arsenic level increases in the concentrate beyond a certain level, it can impair the rate of oxidation unless countermeasures are adopted ( Holder, 2007 ).

This process is repeated to concentrate the gold bearing ore and separate it from the waste rock (increasing the grade of the ore). The flotation units catch 70% of the gold collected at Macraes, with the primary roughers collecting the other 30%. The slurry that doesn't contain any gold is neutralised and sent to the tailings dam. The concentrate is thickened and then fed

Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity – known as dor – typically containing between 60-90% gold.

06.02.2018Froth flotation works by exploiting the hydrophobic properties of gold molecules. First, ore is ground into an extremely fine powder. The powdered ore is mixed with water to create a slurry, which is mixed with surfactants to increase the gold's hydrophobicity. This mixture is placed into a large tank filled with distilled water.
