## Conveyor Chute Spillage: Leading Reasons and Solutions
Chute Spillage Reason 3: Poor Material Flow. Because the load zone is a region of constant, intense activity, it creates many conditions that challenge material flow. For example, product fines rise, float, and settle in surrounding areas, such as the bearings and the head pulley. The product also can stick to the sides of the chute.

## Design and Review of Millmerran Coal Handling Plant
A detailed review of the coal handling plant, conveyors and chutes was carried out. The solution was to connect the Reclaim conveyor to the Stacker conveyor system through a Re-blending conveyor system. By using this method the coal can be stacked in the emergency area until it is dry enough for handling.
