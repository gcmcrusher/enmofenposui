## Prediction method of unburnt carbon for coal fired utility boiler 
The method consists of an image processing unit and a furnace model unit. The temperature distribution of combustion flames can be obtained through the former unit. The latter calculates dynamics of the carbon reduction from the burner stages to the furnace outlet using coal feed rate, air flow rate, and the chemical and ash content of the coal.
