## Nano Grinding Mills Methods — When Smallest is Best
Nano Grinding Mills: Tiny Particles Can Be a Big Deal. Justin Klinger, Jun 16, 2022 9:22:00 AM. Nanonization (sometimes also called nanoization) refers to the processes used to make particles that range in size from 1 nanometer (nm) to 100 nm. Many biological processes are nanoscale. In the human body, hemoglobin measures about 5.5 nm in diameter.

## Cutting/grinding off small amount glass? 
20.10.2006Just a note of caution: When sanding/grinding glass, be sure to wear a good respirator. Silica dust + lungs = not good. I once had a glass shop increase the four radiused corners of a 30 X 60 X 1/4 safety glass from 5/16 to 5/8, and they used a belt sander. Which is obviously a good tool for the job.
