## Mould Core Material for the Steel Foundry 
Publisher Summary. This chapter discusses the sources of sand. The workability and the physical properties of mould materials are very much governed by the grain size and shape of the silica sand when this is used as the basis material, while the refractoriness of the grains will be governed by the mineralogical constitution of the sand.

## Moulding Sand: Types and Constituents 
It is made of silica sand and clay, without the addition of used sand. Different forms of carbon known as facing materials, (e.g., plumbago powder, ceylon lead or graphite) are used to prevent the metal from burning into the sand. Sometimes they are mixed with 6 to 15 times fine moulding sand to make mould facings.
