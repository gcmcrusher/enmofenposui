## BASIC CEMENT PLANT LAYOUT 
Quarrying is done through drilling and subsequently, using heavy earth moving equipment such as bulldozers, payloaders, and dumpers. The quarried raw material is then transported to the cement plant, using mechanical conveying equipment such as ropeways or belt conveyors, or by vehicles like wagons and trucks. The quarried limestone is normally

## Ball Charge 
11.04.2021Short mills will have coarser ball charges and therefore in order to accomplish any fine grinding short mills tend to have high circulating loads. The actual throughput capacity is related to mill diameter, (something akin to increasing a pipe's diameter to get more flow). This is supported by a survey of mills where we compare L/D ratios and circulating loads shown in

## Ball Mill Steel Balls Quantity 
When the rotate speed of ball mill is fixed, and the total volume of all the steel balls only takes 10% of the ball mill cylinder, the steel balls mainly do sliding motion instead of cascade movement. When the steel balls quantity reaches to about 30%, the movement of steel balls is also mainly sliding motion.

Ball milling is a mechanical technique that is broadly used to grind powders into fine particles [134–141]. The reactants are generally broken apart using solvent molecules in the traditional method; but in ball milling, reactants are broken by using mechanical forces. The term mechanochemistry has been introduced very recently [142].
