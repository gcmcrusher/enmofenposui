Aug 03, 2012If the mill is rotated too fast, the balls can be thrown too far and just strike the far end of the mill and conversely, if the mill is rotated to slow, the efficiency of the grinding process significantly reduced. Ball mills are suited for finer grinding as larger particles do not impede the impact on to smaller particle as in rod mills.
