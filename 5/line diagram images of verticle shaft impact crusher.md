## Impact Crushers 
Impact crushers (also known as impactors or horizontal shaft impactors) can be used in primary, secondary, or tertiary applications. They use inertia of the blowbars fitted to the rotor to fracture the material, resulting in a high reduction ratio. Impactors are often used as a cost effective alternative to jaw and cone combination plants as

Pumping stations can be grouped as follows: - pumping water from a water source such as a river; - for lifting water (high quantity, low pressure) from a well; - for pumping water into a supply system, elevated water tank or water tower; - to increase pressure. Pumping stations for the first two functions are generally of 2-20 m lifting capacity.

## Failure Analysis Of Machine Shafts 
16.07.2012For most machine shafts, however, analysis should be relatively straightforward. That's because the failure typically provides strong clues to the type and magnitude of forces on the shaft and the direction they acted in: The failed parts will tell exactly what happened. There are only four basic failure mechanisms: corrosion, wear, overload

## Femur Shaft Fractures (Broken Thighbone) 
The long, straight part of the femur is called the femoral shaft. When there is a break anywhere along this length of bone, it is called a femoral shaft fracture. This type of broken leg almost always requires surgery to heal. The femoral shaft runs from below the hip to where the bone begins to widen at the knee.

## How to Position the Golf Club at the Top of the Swing 
In this top of the swing shaft position the club will be aiming to the right of the target, or across the line towards it. It can occur when golfers rotate their upper body (hips and shoulders) too much, or when they allow their left arm to bend at the elbow.

## Shaft sinking 
Shaft mining or shaft sinking is the action of excavating a mine shaft from the top down, where there is initially no access to the bottom. Shallow shafts, typically sunk for civil engineering projects, differ greatly in execution method from deep shafts, typically sunk for mining projects.. Shaft sinking is one of the most difficult of all mine development methods: restricted space,
