## Planetary Mills – fritsch
High-speed and versatile. Planetary Mills are ideally suited for fine grinding of hard, medium-hard, soft, brittle, tough and moist materials. The comminution of the material to be ground takes place primarily through the high-energy impact of grinding balls in rotating grinding bowls. The grinding can be performed dry, in suspension or in
