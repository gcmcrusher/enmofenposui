The raw coal is then fed into the pulverizer along with air heated to about 650 degrees F from the boiler. As the coal gets crushed by the rolling action, the hot air dries it and blows the usable fine coal powder out to be used as fuel. The powdered coal from the pulverizer is directly blown to a burner in the boiler.

Therefore, the coal is transported via trains to the fuel storage space. The size of coal is very large that is not suitable for the boiler. So, the coal is crushed in small pieces via crusher and fed to the boiler. To produce steam in the boiler, a high amount of water is also required in the thermal power plant.

Pieces of coal are crushed between balls or cylindrical rollers that move between two tracks or races. The raw coal is then fed into the pulveriser along with air heated to about 330 C from the boiler. As the coal gets crushed by the rolling action, the hot air dries it and blows the usable fine coal powder out to be used as fuel.

Although stoker systems and fluidized-bed combustion units use relatively coarse-crushed coal, most coal combustion at the present time takes place in pulverized-fuel boilers. One of the objectives of the pulverizer coal in such systems is to reduce the coal particle size so that 70–80% passes through a 200 mesh (75 μm) screen (summary after Scott, 1995).

## What Types of Fuel Used in Power Plant Boiler
Coal. Most industrial coal-fired boilers run on crushed coal, which burns more efficiently than large coal clumps. Gas and Oil. Gas-fired boilers operate using natural gas, most often a mix of methane, ethane, butane, pentane, or propane. Boilers that run gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum-based fuels are typically classified as oil-fired

## Why Pulverized Coal is Used in a Power Plant
Coal for Power Plants. The coal fired power plant converts energy in coal to electricity. The basic input into the system is the fuel that is coal. All other systems and equipment only aid in this conversion process. Before going into the details, let us look at the quantity of coal processed in a power plant.

## What Are The Differences Between CFB Boiler And PC Boiler
13.05.2016Pulverized coal is often conveyed to the burners in boiler through pneumatic means (by forcing coal particles by using moving air) from the coal pulverizer mill. But for a CFB boiler, it requires the coal fuel should be crushed to sizes less than 10 mm. The time energy and facility required to crush coal is much lesser than pulverizing coal
