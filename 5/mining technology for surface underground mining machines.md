## Mining Industry's Dangers and the Need for Modernization
08.08.2022A drone's propellers can be broken by a single collision with a hard surface. Mitigating The Risks of Mine Blasting In both surface and underground mining, excavating rocks is often done by miners drilling holes into the rock and then filling those holes with explosives to blast away the tough rock. This method may be used to excavate rocks of

## STUDY MATERIAL 
Surface Mining Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed. It is the other way of underground mining, in which the overlying rock is left behind, and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.
