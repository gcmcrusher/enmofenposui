## Advantages and Disadvantages of Gyratory Crusher over Jaw Crusher 
Disadvantages of gyratory crusher: (1) The gyratory crusher is twice the height of the jaw crusher, as a result of which, the construction expenditure of the plant is high. (2) The weight of this machine is 1.7~2 times higher than that of the jaw crusher with the same feeding size, so the investment fee is higher. (3) Gyratory crusher is not

## Crushers 
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.
