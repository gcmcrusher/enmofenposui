By 2040, the capacity gap was expected to increase to 83 Mt, demonstrating a long-term need for investment in bauxite mining capacity. In the early 2020s, however, we expected a short-term global surplus of bauxite as the result of mine ramp-ups in Guinea (including our client's project), in Australia to a lesser degree and in China.
