13.03.2011Primary crushers reduce the ore from anything as large as 1.5 m down to 100 to 200 mm. Machines such as jaw and gyratory crushers apply a fracture force to the large particles, breaking the ore by compression. In a jaw crusher, ore falls into a wedge-shaped space between a fixed and a moving crushing plate.
