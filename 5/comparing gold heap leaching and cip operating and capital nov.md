The lower capital and operation cost makes the heap and dump leaching with carbon adsorption process and electrowinning a very attractive method. Modifications such as agglomeration, cyanide curing may be incorporated in the heap leaching technique to increase the gold recoveries from 50-60 percent to 75-85 percent.

Mining has advanced primarily through the use of two strategies: pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. Both have been used successfully to extract valuable metals from ore deposits. These strategies, without a doubt, harm the environment. Furthermore, due to decades of excessive mining, there has been a global decline in high-grade ores. This has resulted in a
