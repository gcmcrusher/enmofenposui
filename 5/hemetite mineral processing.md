## ﻿mineral processing low grade iron ore hematite
However, low-grade hematite ores cannot be used directly in blast furnaces because of their low iron minerals content, which are associated with quartz and other gangue minerals (Yu et al., 2017). Therefore, low-grade hematite ores must be treated by mineral processing methods (e.g., flotation and magnetic separation) to obtain the iron

## mining of hematite
 In Asia, a great deal of mining for hematite ore is done in China. Known reserves include the Tung-Yeh-Chen hematite deposit and the Dongye hematite deposit. One of the major advantages hematite ore has over other types like magnetite is its high iron content. That makes the iron extraction process much less costly and time consuming.

09.04.2020Based on the properties of the mineral in question, it can be assumed that Hematite is described. Indeed, according to the existing data, the hardness of Hematite varies from 1.5 to 6.0, which includes the point of 2.5. Also, Hematite is described as "soft," which also complies with the information concerning the mineral to be defined.

01/12/2002Currently, a commercial hot water extraction process is used to extract the oil (bitumen) from the oil sands. During this process, the heavy minerals are concentrated in the bitumen froths and are left in the froth treatment tailings, which on average contain about 10% TiO 2 and 1.4% ZrO 2 (Oxenford et al., 2001). At these grades, the froth
