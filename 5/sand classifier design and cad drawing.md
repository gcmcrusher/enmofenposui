## Drawing Revision Standard? 
09.10.2009My design group is in the midst of a debate regarding drawing revision standards. Some argue that each sheet has an independent revision record (i.e. rev 1 on one drawing may be different than rev 1 on another). Another group argues that a rev is universal across a drawing set, but only affected drawings are marked with the revision.

## Design, analysis and classifier evaluation for a CAD tool for breast 
It is observed that the SVM classifier for the MLP kernel choice is performing better in comparison to all other classifiers in consideration along with the other design steps of a CAD tool. In this paper, the design, analysis, and classifier evaluation for a computer aided diagnostics (CAD) tool for early breast cancer detection from mammograms is presented.
