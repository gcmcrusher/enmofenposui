## Grinding 
Depths of cut are small (cf. creep feed grinding, about 25 mm): roughing, 0.1–0.4 mm; finishing 0.01–0.025 mm; Grinding ratios vary from 2 to 200, although high grinding ratios frequently give rise to poor surface integrity. For form grinding wheels are dressed to shape using diamond dressing tools or by "crush dressing".
