## Magnetic separation 
Magnetic separation is also used in situations where pollution needs to be controlled, in chemical processing, as well as during the benefaction of nonferrous low-grade ores. Magnetic separation is also used in the following industries: dairy, grain and milling, plastics, food, chemical, oils, textile, and more. Magnetic cell separation

Generally se ferrous components are low grade and weakly magnetic. Dause of this they are difficult to separate out. With these jes in mind LONGi Magnet Co. has designed a line of gnetic separators specifically developed to remove these iurities and increase the purity of the non-ferrous minerals.
