## Ball Mills 
In addition to well-proven mixing and size reduction processes, these mills also meet all technical requirements for colloidal grinding and provide the energy input necessary for mechanical alloying. The extremely high centrifugal forces of a planetary ball mill result in very high pulverization energy and therefore short grinding times.

## Ball milling as an important pretreatment technique in 
12.08.2021In terms of final particle size, wet ball milling is more suitable to reduce the particle size below 1 m compared to dry ball milling . In addition, wet ball milling suppresses the role of surface forces and prevents the agglomeration tendency of fine particles to get narrow particle size distribution . Dry ball milling produces particles with a wide size distribution. Lin et al.
