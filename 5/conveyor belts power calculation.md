## Design Considerations for Conveyor Belt Idlers
21.08.2010There are three types of idlers used in the conveyor industry, out of which only the flat belt conveyor idler design calculations are discussed here theoretically. We have not used the factor of safety in the design calculations here, or in other words the factor of safety is considered as one through out the calculations. The theoretical calculations are ideal for the

## Conveyor Belts Power Calculation 
Belt Conveyor Power Calculation Program for Bulk Handling. Since one horsepower (HP) = 33,000 ft-lbs/min, required conveyor drive power may be expressed in HP as follows, (Te in lbs) x (V in fpm)/ ( (33,000 ft-lbs/min)/HP) = HP After calculating Te, it is important to calculate T2 slip (slack side tension required to resist slippage of the belt on the pulley.)

## How to calculate motor drive torque for belt and pulley systems
07.06.2019Tc = torque required during constant velocity (Nm) Fa = total axial force (N) r1 = radius of drive pulley (mm) Œ∑ = efficiency of belt drive system. Notice that the efficiency (Œ∑) of the belt drive system is included in the torque equation. This efficiency accounts for losses such as friction between the belt and pulleys.

## Horsepower calculation 
In order to calculate horsepower, it is necessary to determine the resultant force (R) due to the weight (W) acting at incline angle (a) Force (R) equals Weight (W) multiplied by sine (a). Sines of common incline angles are listed in weights and tables. The force (T) required to move the load is the sum of the resultant force (R), plus the

## power calculation formula for belt conveyors
Mar 09, 2006 If I ever need to calculate approximate conveyor power, for example on simple in-plant inclined conveyors, I often do the following simple calculation. Power = t/h x lift x 2.72 x 1.3 kW From this you can easily calculate the torque, if you have the speed and pulley diameter from the following:

TC = F 1 x L x CW: F 1 = .035‚Ä≥ [Normal friction factor for average conditions (over 20F) to move empty belt.] L = Belt length (ft.)CW = Weight of conveyor belt components. (Table A of the Engineering Manual) TL = F 2 x L x MW F 2 = .04‚Ä≥ [Normal friction factor to move load horizontally.] L = Belt length (ft.)MW = Material weight (lbs. per lineal foot).
