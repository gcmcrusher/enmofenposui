It is a non-toxic, odorless, and pollution-free inorganic non-metallic material and high-tech ultra-fine inorganic new material. The size is between 1~100nm, and it has a three-dimensional network structure, which is easy to agglomerate and has poor storage stability.

## Introduction to nano ceramic powder and its applications
Ceramic materials have better mechanical properties and less thermal conductivity. They are therefore used in refractory and coating applications. Nano ceramic powders are also of great importance in the industry due to their very small size. There are various ways to produce nano powders, such as ballmilling, sol gel, freeze dryer, etc.
