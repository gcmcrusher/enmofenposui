Spray drying involves atomizing concentrated milk (or other liquids) into a hot air stream (180 – 220 C). The atomizer may be either a pressure nozzle or a centrifugal disc. By controlling the size of the droplets, the air temperature, and the airflow, it is possible to evaporate almost all the moisture while exposing the solids to relatively
