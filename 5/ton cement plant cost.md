Despite these problems, cement kilns have been run on pure petcoke, and a 50:50 coal:petcoke mix is a fairly normal fuel mix nowadays. The increase in the use of petcoke has of course been due to the fact that green coke with metals contents too high for electrochemical use became a low-cost waste by-product.
