## Metso Reports on Industry's Largest HPGR at Morenci Copper
The HRC 3000 began operations at the Morenci copper mine in May 2014. According to the company, it's the largest of its kind in the world, allowing the mill to employ fewer equipment lines. Metso reported recently that the unit had operated for more than 8,400 hours and has crushed more than 34 million tons (t) of porphyry copper ore.
