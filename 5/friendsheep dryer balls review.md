## How to Recharge Wool Dryer Balls Why To Do It 
15.10.2020Alternatively, don't wait for your dryer balls to start to wear down just wash and refresh them every once in awhile. I'd recommend recharging them once every 100 loads or so. Most wool dryer ball manufacturers say their dryer balls will last at least 1000 loads. This means you'll only need to refresh your dryer balls 10 over their lifetime.

## Are Wool Dryer Balls Worth It? 
Short answer: yes they do! Dryer balls can dramatically reduce your drying times (sometimes even by 25%!!), they soften clothes, and, if used correctly, they reduce static in your laundry.

Affordable and reusable, dryer balls generally cost between $10 and $30. The priciest sets contain six to eight top-quality organic wool balls and run between $20 and $30. For $10 to $20, you can get a similar set made of lesser-quality wool. Plastic dryer ball sets also tend to be in the $10 to $20 range.
