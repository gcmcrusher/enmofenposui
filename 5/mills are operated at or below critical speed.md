## Critical speed 
Critical speed depends upon the magnitude and location of the shaft unbalance, the length of the shaft, its diameter, and the kind of bearing support. Many practical applications suggest as good practice that the maximum operating speed should not exceed 75% of the critical speed; however, there are cases that require speeds above the critical speed to work correctly.

Electric motors have a range of industrial applications, including the operation of pumps, compressors and fans. Motors use substantial energy and can incur significant running costs, meaning great potential for savings. Most motor energy consumption in Australia is mid-size motors with output power between 0.75kW to 375kW.
