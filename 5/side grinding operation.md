## Abrasive Wheel Safety 
However, for certain precision grinding operations it may be necessary to allow the side of the wheel to lightly touch a face adjoining the surface being ground, for example the thrust face on a stepped shaft, and in this case the side of the wheel may be lightly dressed with a diamond to create a shallow relief.
