The unit can be used to perform standard or modified compaction tests using a 5.5lb hammer with 12″ height of drop or a 10lb hammer with 18″ drop. Hammer lift compensates the height of the drop for soil thickness in the mold during compaction. The weight of the hammer is concentrated at the foot, allowing free fall of the hammer.
