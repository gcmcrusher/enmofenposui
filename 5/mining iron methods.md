## What is Underground mining and How it works 
16.03.2021Underground mining or underground hard rock mining means various underground mining equipments to excavate minerals, especially those containing metal, such as gold, silver, iron, copper, zinc, nickel, tin, and lead. Therefore, to find good mining and quarrying machinery and equipment, you must choose suitable underground mining equipment

## Open Pit Mining
17.02.2021Open pit mining is widely used with metallic ore bodies (aluminum, bauxite, copper, iron), and nearly all nonmetallic (coal, uranium, phosphate, etc.). It is a traditional cone-shaped excavation (although it can be of any shape,

## Geology and mining — MineFacts
Iron ores, which have a high content (often over 30 per cent) generate less tailings than sulphide ores The mining method is based on the ore being extracted in benches at successively lower levels. These benches give the open pit a characteristic stepped appearance. Extraction in open pits is done in a number of productions stages.

## Iron ore beneficiation technology and process
17.12.2020Roasting magnets are used to sort weakly magnetic iron ore with complex mineral composition and other sorting methods that do not work well. The common process flow in actual production is: the raw ore is fed into the shaft furnace for roasting and magnetization, and after magnetization, it is fed into the magnetic separator for magnetic separation.

## Opencast Mining 
Coal is mined either by surface methods (open-cut or open-cast mining) or by underground techniques. In surface mining, all of the rock from the ground surface to the top of the seam (material referred to as overburden) is removed and set aside to expose the coal, which is then taken out and transported from the mine for preparation and use ( Figure 11 ).
