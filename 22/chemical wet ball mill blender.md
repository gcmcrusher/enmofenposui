In this study, ultra-thin and easily dispersible g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets were obtained by a simple wet ball-milling process. Morphological and structural analysis showed that increasing ball-milling speed resulted in a decrease in both particle size and the number of stacked layers in g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, hence improving their dispersion stability. Thinner nanosheets obtained by
