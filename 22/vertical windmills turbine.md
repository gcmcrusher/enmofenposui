## Vertical Axis Wind Turbine Project Report 
05.01.2021Vertical Axis Wind Turbines are a type of wind turbine who's rotor shaft is set vertically which is mostly perpendicular to the direction of the wind. These turbines rotate on a vertical axis, and the main components in such turbines are located in the base of the turbine. This kind of arrangement helps in the repair and maintenance of the generator and gearbox.

## A historical review of vertical axis wind turbines rated 100 kW 
01.05.2019Vertical axis windmills might have been in use in the Afghan highlands as early as the 7th century BC . These early VAWTs were simple devices based on aerodynamic drag rather than on aerodynamic lift. One side of the turbine was covered and the wind simply pushed the blades on the power-generating side of the turbine and thus created torque. Using the
