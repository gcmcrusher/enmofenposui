Lower wear rate of the alloy is correlated with the higher hardness, elongation and work hardening. The adhesion wear and abrasive wear are the primary wear mechanism. It was found that the fine-grained alloy shows lower sliding wear rate only by combining severe plastic deformation with heat treatment.
