Feldspar commonly found in the Earth's crust and in a great deal of sand. Over time, and through the action of the wind, waves and erosion, quartz and feldspar combine (along with other materials such as bone, shell, coral, glass and as many should now be aware, plastic) and forms sand on beaches, river beds and around lakes and other shorelines.

On the other hand by increasing Fineness Modulus from 2.5 to 3, the strength increases from 4.25 to 4.81 MPa resulting in 13.1% increase in strength. For Every 0.1 increase in FM of sand from 2.0 to 3.0, Flexural Strength increases by 2.1 to .5%. The increase in strength is more towards coarser side of sand.

Followings are the classification of Sand: Based on the grain size of the particle, sand is classified as Fine Sand (0.075 to 0.425mm), Medium Sand (0.425 to 2mm), and Coarse Sand (2.0 mm to 4.75mm) Based on origin, sand is classified as Pit sand, River sand, Sea sand, and manufactured sand.

## Suitability of Quartz Sands for Different Industrial Applications
01.01.2014The suitability of quartz sand for different industrial applications is determined by the quality of the sand in terms of : — Grain size distribution. Normally unprocessed sand may be suitable for a limited range of applications. Washing and sizing increases considerably the possible product range. — Chemical analysis.

The silt contents should not be more than 4%. The quality of the sand has more impact on the strength of the structure inspite of the quantity of the cement used. 1) If there is more silt in coarse sand, the strength of cement mortar is reduced from 1 % to 30%. 2) If you take best quality coarse sand, it will give maximum strength.

## Can you use sand as a backfill? Reasons for using sand when backfilling.
Because of this, many construction benefits make use of sand as their primary backfill material. Of course, not all projects are the same. In some situations, it may be better to use a combination of material that is coarse but still strong enough to support the structure. 3. It should be stable and well-compacted.

For a good concrete mix, aggregates need to be clean, hard, strong particles free of absorbed chemicals or coatings of clay and other fine materials that could cause the deterioration of concrete. Aggregates, which account for 60 to 75 percent of the total volume of concrete, are divided into two distinct categories--fine and coarse. Fine aggregates generally consist of
