## What Are the Pros and Cons of Using Ball Screws? 
01.02.2019Ball screws offer a high level of mechanical efficiency. Statistics show that ball screws are about 90% efficient, meaning they are able to convert nine-tenths of the application's rotational motion into linear motion. In comparison, lead screws have an average mechanical efficiency of just 20% to 25%. Based on these numbers, it's safe to

## Linear and Rotary Motion Problems with ball screws and nuts.
17.02.2008I have a CNC wood router with 24 X 36 cutting capacity. It uses Nook ball screws with SBN7500 double recirculating ball nuts. A short time ago I had a problem with my X axis motion. After sitting for a couple of months when I started using the machine again the x axis travel was binding resulting in a somewhat jerky motion causing the cutting tool to create

## What may cause premature failure of ball screws or ball nuts?
Lack of lubrication. Proper lubrication will help dissipate heat and reduce metal-to-metal wear of components. Insufficient lubrication is one of the primary reasons for premature ball screw or ball nut failure. Dirt or debris in the ball nut or ball paths preventing free circulation of the ball bearings. The ball bearings may get flats on them

## Ballscrews 
Ball screws are more efficient and have a longer life span than acme or trapezoidal threads. The main reason behind a ball screw's efficiency is the presence of ball bearings that are housed within the nut. The bearings run on the cold-rolled thread, greatly reducing the amount of friction between the screw and nut themselves. The design of the
