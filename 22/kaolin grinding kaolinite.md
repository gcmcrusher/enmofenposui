## Grinding of kaolinite processing 
The effect of grinding on the structure of kaolinite has been known for some time (1-4). The effect of grinding of soils containing kaolinite has also been elucidated (5). This effect influences the cation exchange capacity of the soil (6). In the 1960's the grinding of kaolinite was thought to produce a zeolite-like material

## What is Kaolin 
Kaolin or china clay is a commercial clay composed principally of the hydrated aluminosilicate clay mineral kaolinite. The commercial value of kaolin is based on the mineral's whiteness and its fine, controllable particle size. Particle size affects fluidity, strength, plasticity, colour, abrasiveness and ease of dispersion.

## Kaolinite: The clay mineral kaolinite information and pictures
Kaolinite is a clay mineral, with a soft consistency and earthy texture. It is easily broken and can be molded or shaped, especially when wet. Kaolinite is a lackluster and uninteresting mineral on its own, but it occasionally forms interesting pseudomorphs, especially after feldspars. It is also a common accessory to other minerals, including gem crystals in decomposing feldspar

## Effect of Dry Grinding on Kaolin Minerals 
Abstract. The effect of dry grinding of kaolin minerals by a mechanical mortar was examined by x-ray, thermal, and electron microscopic methods. Base exchange capacity and apparent density were also measured. In the early stage of grinding, kaolin crystals cleave and fracture and then split into fine crystals which are considered unit crystallites.

End Note: Delamination is the grinding or cleaving of kaolinite stacks into finer platy particles. Delamination technology allowed producers to use coarse kaolin stacks that had mostly been used as paper filler. The US Bureau of Mines in the late 1950s developed attrition grinding of clay slurries with sand or other media to delaminate and separate fine kaolinite platy particles.

26/01/2022Grinding kaolinite results in the formation of a mechanochemically amorphous phase similar to metakaolin, although the properties of this solid are quite different. Great energy is required to convert kaolinite into metakaolin. Drying. Below 100 C (212 F), exposure to dry air will slowly remove liquid water from the kaolin.

Kaolin is a clay mineral, part of the group of industrial minerals with the chemical composition Al2Si2O5 (OH)4. It is a layered silicate mineral, with one tetrahedral sheet of silica (SiO4) linked through oxygen atoms to one octahedral sheet of alumina (AlO6) octahedra. Rocks that are rich in kaolinite are known as kaolin or china clay.
