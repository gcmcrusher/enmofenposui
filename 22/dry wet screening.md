In sizing analysis of fine material, preliminary screening by washing a weighed sample on a 200-mesh screen, perhaps with use of a dispersing agent, such as sodium silicate. Removal of the minus fraction (which is settled and later brought into account) is followed by drying of the on-size and by standard sizing analysis. Screen action is thus

## wet vs dry screening in mineral processing 
Wet screening is typically used for processes that involve finer feed material, or in cases where the material has a high moisture content that makes it more difficult to dry screen. Sometimes, desiccation is required at the end of the process in order to remove the liquid used in the wet screening process.
