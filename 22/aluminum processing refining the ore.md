## Aluminium Mining And Processing 
MINING AND PROCESSING : Aluminium is mined from bauxite-contained mining areas since the production of aluminium is entirely reliable on extraction from bauxite. It is not found in free form and is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust. Bauxite is the only ore containing 20-25 percent of aluminium from where the metal is

## Occurrence and Extraction of Aluminium: Hall Heroult Process
07.06.2022Aluminium is a very light metal that is non-toxic, non-magnetic, and does not spark. The extraction of Aluminium is mostly done in industries by The Hall-Heroult Process. The process includes - Concentration of Bauxite, Electrolysis of Alumina, and Refining of Aluminium. Hoop's electrolytic method is predominantly used for refining of aluminium.

## How aluminium is made? 
13/08/2022Aluminium is the most plentiful metal in the earth's crust. It is found in the form of aluminium oxide in an ore called bauxite. Alumina and bauxite are the two main raw materials in the aluminium making process. Aluminium is obtained by the electrolysis of alumina which extracts pure aluminium metal from alumina.
