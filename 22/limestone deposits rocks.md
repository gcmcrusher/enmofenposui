## What is Calcium Carbonate Limestone? 
Calcium carbonate limestone, which is also recognized as the chemical compound CaCO3, makes up almost five percent of the earth's crust and is found all throughout the planet. Calcium carbonate's most common natural forms are limestone and marble. These raw materials are mostly produced by the sedimentation of the shells of foraminifera

## Limestone Petrology Sedimentary Rock Information
Limestone is a sedimentary rock, mainly composed of mineral calcite. The primary source of the calcite is usually marine organisms, which settle out of the water column and are deposited on the ocean floors as pelagic ooze (but see lysocline for information on calcite dissolution). Secondary calcite may also be deposited in super-saturated

## Limestone 
Large limestone deposits from ancient reefs are found inland, such as the exposed limestone in Guadalupe Mountains National Park in New Mexico. Chalk is another form of biochemically produced limestone. Chalk is a soft, porous rock made up of the skeletal parts of microscopic marine organisms. It produces the white cliffs of Dover, England.

## Limestone uses â€” Science Learning Hub
The calcium carbonate content of limestone rocks has been used from the earliest civilisations, dating back to 14,000 BCE, to its extensive use in modern times. It is a valuable resource that services the needs of a multitude of industries. Annual New Zealand usage of limestone in the year 2010 was: marl and cement â€“ 2 million tonnes.

## Limestone Rocks 
Limestone is a fine to medium grained crystalline rock. It chiefly is composed of the mineral calcite. Ohio limestone sometimes contains the fossil remains of animals or plants that lived in the oceans from which the limestone was formed. Limestone typically is formed by the precipitation of calcium carbonate, which is the chemical substance
