In our two-compartment cement mills, the first compartment (for coarse grinding) has a step lining suitable for large grinding media. It protects the shell while ensuring optimum lifting of the mill charge. In the second compartment (and also in our one-compartment cement mills) we use a corrugated lining designed to obtain the maximum power absorption and grinding efficiency.
