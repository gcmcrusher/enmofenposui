## Mineral Resources 
Iron ore, one of the Philippines' largest mineral deposits, is not being extracted at present. This was due to the higher cost of production, making the local prices of iron not competitive to world prices. However, exploration for possible mining sites is still being done. In 1989, there was an addition of 10.1 million MT in total reserves. Several mining areas explored in 1992 were
