## Dissolution and reduction of chromite ore in ferrochromium slags
chromite ore was fed into the molten slag, and was followed by reduction of iron and chromium oxides. Due to the fact that the chromite ore was fed in granular form, as expected, a greater contact area was created which influenced the dissolution / reduction reaction between the ore and the slag. The slag composition played a significant role in the dissolution and reduction

Description. Chromium (Cr) is a hard, bluish metallic element. The only ore of chromium is the mineral chromite and 99 percent of the world's chromite is found in southern Africa and Zimbabwe. Geologists estimate that there are about 11 billion tons of mineable chromite ore in the world, enough to supply the current demand for hundreds of years.
