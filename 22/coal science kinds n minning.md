Coal is a non-clastic sedimentary rock. They are the fossilized remains of plants and are in flammable black and brownish-black tones. Its main element is carbon, but it can also contain different elements such as hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen. Unlike coal minerals, it does not have a fixed chemical composition and crystal structure.

## The Challenges of Reusing Mining and Mineral
Aug 10, 2012The origin of mining and mineral-processing wastes is closely related to the formation of the target resource or minerals. For example, many coal deposits exist in subsided regions resulting from mountain formation; hence, the overlays of coal resources are generally not very thick and consist of relatively inactive sedimentary rocks.

## What is coal where is it found? 
Once this has been confirmed, mining operations begin. As coal reserves are found across the globe, the largest coal producing regions are not confined to one region â€“ the top five hard coal producers are China, India, USA, Indonesia and Australia. Most coal production is actually used in the country in which it was produced.

## What are the main methods of mining? 
There are four main mining methods: underground, open surface (pit), placer, and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels, beach
