## Mechanical Dredging vs. Hydraulic Dredging 
28.05.2019Some advocates may argue that mechanical dredging is an easier and less complicated process for crews. However, hydraulic dredging is cost efficient, offers increased flexibility, and is best suited for challenging environments where excavators are limited. In addition, hydraulic dredging is best for environments when acquiring finely grained

Extraction and refining TiCl 4. The production of titanium metal accounts for only 5 percent of annual titanium mineral consumption; the rest goes to the titanium pigment industry. Pigments are produced using either a sulfate process or a more environmentally acceptable carbo-chlorination process (described below) that converts TiO 2 into TiCl 4.The latter process also supplies the

## Sand Casting Process, Defects, Design 
The sand casting process involves the use of a furnace, metal, pattern, and sand mold. The metal is melted in the furnace and then ladled and poured into the cavity of the sand mold, which is formed by the pattern. The sand mold separates along a parting line and the solidified casting can be removed.

## Sand filtration 
The hydraulic speed of discontinuous sand filters varies between 3 and 20 m 3 /m 2 /hour, with an average of approximately 10 m 3 /m 2 /hour. The flow speed is determined by the desired end result. Slow sand filters have a surface load of 0.1-0.2 m/m/hour. Continuous sand filters have a hydraulic speed of 5-10 m 3 /m 2 /hour. Effectiveness

Refining from scrap. The processing of gold scrap varies not only with the gold content but also with the amenability of the gold in the scrap to extraction. Thus, the bulk of the gold may be recovered by leaching techniques using cyanidation or aqueous chlorination, and the residue may then be treated by smelting to recover the balance. Generally, scrap with a gold content of less

Two processes have been developed for the refining of edible oils and fats, i.e. physical and chemical refining; the decision which process to use depends on the types and qualities of the crude oil to be processed (Fig. 1).The names physical and chemical refining come from the process technology used to remove the free fatty acids (FFA) that are
