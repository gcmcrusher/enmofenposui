18.02.2022Coal is dense at 50C, and there are very few micro-cracks. A clear and tortuous line can be observed on the coal surface. The thermal fracture of coal gradually evolves and develops with an increase in the oxidation temperature. When the temperature is 50–200C, the first thermal fracture area is a tortuous crack on the original coal surface.
