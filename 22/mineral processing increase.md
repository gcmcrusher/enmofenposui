## Mineral Evolution 
New mineral-forming processes arise from consequent fluid-rock interactions that operate on a vast scale. Immense hydrothermal ore deposits, vast metamorphic terrains, and the appearance of high-pressure minerals at Earth's surface all characterize Stage 5, which increased mineral diversity to perhaps 1500 species formed by purely physical and chemical processes.
