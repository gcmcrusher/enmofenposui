03.06.2022But now the question comes that after all how much electricity can it actually generate. So let's see some calculations for it. Since a 1kW solar system generates = 4 units/day. Accordingly, 1MW will generate, 4 units x 1000kW = 4,000 units/day (1MW = 1000kW), 4,000 units x 30 days = 1,20,000 units/month.
