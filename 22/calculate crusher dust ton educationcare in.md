A general rule would be that if the material is compactible (e.g. crusher run, select fill, stone dust), you should use a factor of 1.5 tons per cubic yard. If the material is "self-compacting," meaning that it tends to be used for drainage (sized stone for example), you should use a factor of 1.25 tons per cubic yard.

## Stone Dust Doesn't Belong Under Pavers. Here's Why.
Stone dust is a fine material that absorbs moisture readily, then releases it slowly. The same properties that work wonders for organic gardening can wreak havoc underneath pavers, causing efflorescence and allowing them to settle or shift easily under load. In extreme frost-thaw cycles, water-soaked stone dust can actually pump up through the

For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80–85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 1.7 = 78 cm.
