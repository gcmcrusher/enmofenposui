## Manganese Ore 
Manganese ore is required in iron making to control the manganese content of the hot metal in the desired range. The most important manganese ores are the oxides pyrolusite, romanechite, manganite, hausmannite and the carbonate ore rhodochrosite. Rhodonite and braunite, both silicate ores, are frequently found with the oxides.

Manganese ores can be carbonates, usually rhodochrosite but sometimes kutnahorite, or various silicates and oxides, the most common being braunite, bixbyite, and hausmannite [see table of common minerals]. The carbonates carry useful isotope signals for C and O [see stable isotopes of Mn deposits]. On a purely descriptive basis, Mn ores can be

## What is Manganese Ore? 
Manganese ore is an oxide mineral found in sedimentary rocks composed of manganese, iron and oxygen. In steel production, manganese ore is vital to create several essential alloys such as ferromanganese, silicomanganese and manganese metal. In addition to steel production, one can find manganese ore in battery cathodes and in fertilizer

## Vibrational Spectroscopic Study for Qualitative Assessment of Mn
Manganese oxide ore is used mostly in alloy making, steel making and batteries (Indian Bureau of Mines, 2013). Use of such ore depends on its Mn content and other gangue constituents (minerals). Conventionally, the ore is chemically analyzed to ﬁnd out its grade, so astouseitforaspeciﬁcpurpose.However,wetchemical analysis is a time consuming process.

Manganese fines. With their high manganese content, our fines have been developed for the production of silicomanganese (SiMn). This ore is used to improve process performance (less waste, reduced energy consumption), particularly in the production of agglomerates. Its low iron content makes it highly complementary to iron rich ores.
