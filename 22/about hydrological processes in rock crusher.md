## Types of Crushers: What You Need to Know 
The Gates' gyratory crushers were preferred by the mining industry for almost two decades until the turn of the century, circa 1910, when Blake's jaw crushers saw a resurgence in popularity. The demand for large-mouthed jaw crushers skyrocketed as the industry began to understand their potential as primary crushers in rock quarries.

## Rock mass classification 
but chemically intact rock has the character of crusher run. If most or all of the fragments are as small as fine sand grains and no recementation has taken place, crushed rock below the water table exhibits the properties of a water-bearing sand. ξ Squeezing rock slowly advances into the tunnel without perceptible volume increase.

## Cone Crushers 
A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.
