## Ball Mill Parameter Selection Calculation 
30.08.2019The wear of grinding steel balls is related to the surface area of steel balls. In general, the steel ball in the grinder has both impact and abrasion effects, so the wear is proportional to the n power of the diameter of the steel ball, and the value of n is between 2 and 3. Table 1-11 The Relation between Steel Ball Diameter and Material Size

23.04.2018Analysis Of Grinding Time Of Planetary Ball Mill: No Useless Work. Apr 23, 2018. In our fixed mind, the longer the grinding time of planetary ball mills is, the finer the material will be, but during the experiment or production process, the grinding time is not proportional to the size of the material being discharged.
