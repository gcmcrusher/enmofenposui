## Heap Leaching: Extending Applications 
Minus 6-in. (150-mm) ore was laid down on the leaching heaps in 5- to 6-m lifts, with a six-month leach cycle before a new lift was added above. The top 1 ft (300 mm) of each lift was decompacted by ripping before leaching began. The next stage in heap-leaching development, using the concept for gold recovery, was swift to follow.

## Gold 
The successful application of heap leaching to the extraction of gold from low-grade deposits has been one of the main factors in higher output since the 1970s, especially in the United States. It is a low cost process that extracts a soluble precious metal or copper compound by dissolving the metal content from the crushed ore.

There are two types of leaching: Heap leaching: In the open, cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads. The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap. The pad collects the now metal-impregnated solution which is stripped of gold and resprayed on the heap until the ore is
