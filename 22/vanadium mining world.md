15.07.2020The world mining production is plotted in Fig. 2. From 1912 to 1960 production of vanadium was quite low and did not exceed 5000 t. A significant increase occurred between 1960 and 1980 when mine production jumped from 5000 to 38,000 t. Over the next 20 years production stagnated, and it was not until 2000 (41,000 t) that the value of 1980 was further
