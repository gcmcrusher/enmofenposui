28.04.2022The most common beneficiation method for feldspar is flotation with a cationic (amine) collector under acidic conditions. However, there are several disadvantages to this, such as environmental pollution and equipment corrosion. In order to resolve such problems, it is important to study the flotation of feldspar using anionic collectors under natural pH
