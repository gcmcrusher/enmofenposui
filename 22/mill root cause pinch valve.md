## Mild Procedure for Lower Spinal Stenosis (LSS) 
mild is an early treatment option to consider when conservative therapies (e.g., physical therapy, pain medication, chiropractic) are not providing adequate relief. The mild Procedure addresses a major root cause of LSS by removing excess ligament tissue to restore space in the spinal canal. The mild Procedure typically takes less than

## Control Valve Basics: Sizing and Selection 
A control valve is comprised of an actuator mechanism that is capable of changing the position of flow controlling element in the valve. The valve modulates flow through movement of a valve plug in relation to the port(s) located within the valve body. The valve plug is attached to a valve stem, which, in turn, is connected to the actuator.

## Ball valve 
A ball valve is a flow control device which uses a hollow, perforated and pivoting ball to control liquid flowing through it. It is open when the ball's hole is in line with the flow inlet and closed when it is pivoted 90-degrees by the valve handle, blocking the flow. The handle lies flat in alignment with the flow when open, and is perpendicular to it when closed, making for easy visual
