Abstract Common rare earth (RE) minerals, such as bastnasite and monazite, may be formed in deposits associated with carbonate gangue, such as calcite and dolomite. Sodium oleate is a widely used collector for the flotation of both RE and gangue minerals, which might, therefore, be an inefficient process due to the lack of selectivity of this collector.

## Investigating the use of an ionic liquid for rare earth mineral 
Abstract Common collectors for rare earth mineral (REM) flotation, which include carboxylates and hydroxamates, face problems such as being non-selective and sensitive to impurity ions. A type of ionic liquid (IL), tetraethylammonium mono-(2-ethylhexyl)2-ethylhexyl phosphonate ([N2222][EHEHP]), has been investigated previously for rare earth elements (REE) solvent

Bastnaesite is a fluorocarbonate and is one of the most abundant minerals that contain rare earth elements. The major rare earth elements composing bastnaesite are cerium, lanthanum, and praseodymium, but this may differentiate between ore bodies. The major reserves of Bastnaesite are in China, United States, and Brazil [1].

After applying 17 different collectors from both a fundamental aspect as well as bench flotation based upon a Design of Experimentation optimization process, several novel collectors were found to enhance TREO recovery, grade and gangue rejection in flotation. This is a significant advance as Rare Earth flotation suffers from the lack of selective collectors. In addition,
