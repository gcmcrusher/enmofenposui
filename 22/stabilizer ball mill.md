## Optimization of ball milling parameters to produce Centella 
11.11.2013Ball milling is a common mechanical process to produce superfine powders. In this research, a planetary ball mill was chosen as a grinding tool due to its simplicity. The sieved powder was first mixed with Pluronic F127 and milled at different mass concentrations (0.4%, 1.2%, 2.0%, and 2.8% w/v)) at a constant milling time (4 h) and fixed bead amount (25 g).
