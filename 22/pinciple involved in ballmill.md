## Ball Mill 
D. Sumanth Kumar, H.M. Mahesh, in Synthesis of Inorganic Nanomaterials, 2018 3.6.1.1 Ball Milling. A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend bulk material into QDs/nanosize using different sized balls. The working principle is simple; impact and attrition size reduction take place as the ball drops from near the top of a rotating hollow cylindrical shell.

The working principle of ball mill - Meetyou Carbide. May 22, 2019 The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force.

Vibratory ball mill • Finer powder particles need longer periods for grinding • In this case, vibratory ball mill is better = here high amount of energy is imparted to the particles and milling is accelerated by vibrating the container • This mill contains an electric motor connected to the shaft of the drum by an elastic coupling.

Procedure: Step 1: Take a representative oven-dried sample that weighs approximately 500g. Step 2: If particles are lumped or conglomerated, crush the lumps but not the particles using the pestle and mortar. Step 3: Determine the mass of sample accurately – Weight (g). Step 4: Prepare a stack of test sieves.

## Ball Milling 
Ball milling is a mechanical technique that is broadly used to grind powders into fine particles [134–141]. The reactants are generally broken apart using solvent molecules in the traditional method; but in ball milling, reactants are broken by using mechanical forces. The term mechanochemistry has been introduced very recently [142].

## Solid dispersions: A technology for improving bioavailability
Therefore, solid dispersion technologies are particularly promising for improving the oral absorption and bioavailability of BCS Class II drugs. 3 The basic principle involved in enhancing the poor solubility of drug with solid dispersion includes complete removal of drug crystalline structure and its molecular dispersion in a hydrophilic polymeric carrier.

## Jet mill working principle 
Jet mills have no moving parts, thereby eliminating contamination due to contact with external grinding media. It is also an ideal process to grind heat-sensitive and waxy material because no attritional heat is generated. Jet mill works on fluid energy. Consider a pancake spiral jet mill as an example. Micronizing and classification take place
