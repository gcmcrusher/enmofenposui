## Analysis of life
As the iron ore grade declines, the rate of increase in GHG emissions from mining accelerates. For example, when iron ore grade decreases from 40% to 35%, the average GHG emissions for mining increases by 12 kg CO 2 e/tonne. In contrast, the same 5% iron ore grade decrease from 20% to 15% would lead to 52 kg CO 2 e/tonne.
