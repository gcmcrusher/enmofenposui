## Types of Coal Mining 
When it comes to mining coal, there are two processes by which coal can be removed from the ground: surface mining, or underground mining. In Australia, the majority of coal mining is done via the opencast method, although often the method of choice is dependent on certain characteristics of the coal deposit 1.. The opencast, also referred to as the open-pit method, is

## How Does Coal Mining Affect the Environment? 
05.04.2020By Staff WriterLast Updated April 05, 2020. Coal mining affects the environment in several ways: underground coal mining introduces toxins such as methane gas into waterways and the atmosphere, and surface coal mining contributes to deforestation and erosion. Coal mining displaces large amounts of water, which in turn alters local water tables.

Longwall mining mines a single coal seam in one single tunnel, rather than the many rooms used in the room-and-pillar technique. Contour mining is similar to longwall mining, but it follows the contour of a seam.

## Lesson Plan 
Mining is the process of extracting coal, oil, and natural gas from the ground. Strip mining (also known as open cast, mountaintop, or surface mining) involves scraping away earth and rocks to get to coal buried near the surface

## What is Coal Mining and how is it done?
May 03, 2020Coal mining is the extraction of deposits of coal from the surface of the Earth from the underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. It is always used for producing heat energy

## coal mining 
The fundamental objective of coal prospecting is to discover coal resources through a search. In areas where coal mining has not been previously practiced, the search process should result in obtaining coal samples that give reasonable evidence of the existence of a coal seam. Once a seam has been discovered, considerable further work is necessary in order to advance

## Coal mining 
Coal mining is the process of getting coal out of the ground. It is part of the mining industry.Coal is used as a resource for making electricity.. Extraction. Surface mining is done when the coal is near the surface. Coal miners remove the soil above the coal. The coal can then be removed without the coal miners having to go deep underground..

## Coal Mining 
Coal mining and associated pithead thermal power plants (PHTPPs) are complementary to each other. Vast areas of land are occupied, devastated, and made into wastelands by the mine spoil areas, leaving large voids in the earth. An important part of this assessment process requires mining companies to buy offsets relating to biodiversity

After the coal was cut, the miner used a wrought-iron hand rake having teeth formed to give a clear opening of 1% in. (4.4 cm.) to separate all the coal smaller than stove from the larger pieces. The rake was used in parts of the coal fields as late as 1850, and perhaps later, for it was
