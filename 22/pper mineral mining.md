## Digging deeper: Mining methods explained 
Open-pit, underwater, and underground mining. These are the three main methods of mining we use to extract our products from the ground. In this Digging Deeper article, we take a look at these different methods and provide a glimpse into what each involves. Mining is at the heart of our business at Anglo American.

As in the case of conventional mining, not all material present in the Urban Mine is recoverable. All metals and minerals present in the Urban Mine originated from conventional mining, even if the

## Open Pit Mining Techniques
Open-pit mining, also known as opencast mining, open-cut mining, and strip mining, means a process of digging out rock or minerals from the earth by their elimination from an open pit or borrow. The word is used to distinguish this type of mining from extractive methods that need tunneling into the earth. Open-pit mines are used when deposits

## mineral processing pper
 This copper–molybdenum (Cu–Mo) sulfide ore is generally mined from various locations in the mining site; thus, the mineral composition, oxidation degree, mineral particle size, and grade vary. Therefore, in the mining operation, it is common to blend the ores mined from various spots and then process them using flotation.
