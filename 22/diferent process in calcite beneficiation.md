## How do we extract minerals? 
The primary methods used to extract minerals from the ground are: Underground mining. Surface (open pit) mining. Placer mining. The location and shape of the deposit, strength of the rock, ore grade, mining costs, and current market price of the commodity are some of the determining factors for selecting which mining method to use.

## Beneficiation 
Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step
