## Fertilizer Manufacturing Process 
In the organic fertilizer production, the crushing, blending, pelletizing, screening are essential processes. You'd better equip with these machines. In the same way, you'd better buy a batching equipment for your complex fertilizer making. As for the bulk blending fertilizer processing, mixing is the essential process.

## What is a Data Flow Diagram 
A data flow diagram (DFD) maps out the flow of information for any process or system. It uses defined symbols like rectangles, circles and arrows, plus short text labels, to show data inputs, outputs, storage points and the routes between each destination. Data flowcharts can range from simple, even hand-drawn process overviews, to in-depth
