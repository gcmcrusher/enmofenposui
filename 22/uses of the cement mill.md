Classification: High Calcium Marl: CaO ≥ 45% ; Low calcium marl: CaO 45%. In some places, the composition of marl is close to the raw material for making cement. It can be directly fired into cement, which is called natural cement rock. Main mineral is calcite. White peony: also named chalk, it is a mixture of shells and of marine organisms.

## BALL MILL MAINTENANCE 
Ball mill is generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer, down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve reasonable efficiency with ball mills, they must be operated in a closed system. There is a specific operating speed for the most efficient grinding. At a certain point, controlled by the mill speed, the load nearest the cylinder's wall breaks free, and other
