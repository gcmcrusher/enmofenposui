Calcium carbonate is not only the main component of marble, limestone and dolomite, it is also found in bones and teeth as well as the exoskeleton of crustaceans, coral, muscles, snails and protozoa. A further modification of CaCO 3 is the mineral vaterite, which precipitates out of supersaturated solutions in the form of microscopic crystals.
