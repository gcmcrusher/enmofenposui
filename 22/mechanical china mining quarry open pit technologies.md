## Types of Mining Methods 
Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.

## The Challenges of Open
The rock slope deformation stability for the Antaibao open pit coal mine (China) was analyzed by He et al. [12] using the FDM and FLAC 3D software. An optimal excavated scheme with steeper slope angle was successfully simulated and implemented in this analysis, taking into account the 3D e ects of the nonlinear large deformation of the slope. Pinnaduwa et al. [13] incorporated

## Pump solutions for mining, quarrying and construction
Feb 01, 2022The product being extracted may be inert, e.g. sand, rock, gravel, etc., or containing minerals such as kaolin. With mineral quarrying, the key difference from mining is that here the product is often extracted by hydro-mining and the resultant slurry pumped out of the pit for further processing.
