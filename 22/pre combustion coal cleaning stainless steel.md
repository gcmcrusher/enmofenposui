## Identifying Corrosion in Pre
28.09.2017Pre-combustion refers to a process where fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas), biomass or carbonaceous materials are gasified either in the presence of steam (steam reforming) as shown in Equation 1 or in the presence of limited oxygen (partial oxidation) as shown in Equation 2. The aim is to produce synthesis gas or syngas, which is a combination of carbon
