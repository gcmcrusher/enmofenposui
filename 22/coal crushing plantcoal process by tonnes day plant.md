## Coal washing 
10.04.20191. Improve coal quality and reduce emissions of coal-fired pollutants. Coal washing can remove 50%-80% of ash and 30%-40% of total sulfur (or 60%~80% of inorganic sulfur) in coal. Burning coal can effectively reduce soot, SO2 and NOx. Emissions, washing 100 million tons of thermal coal can generally reduce 600,000 to 700,000 tSO2, remove 16Mt
