## Bioleaching: metal solubilization by microorganisms
01.07.1997To keep enough iron in solution the chemical oxidation of metal sulfides must occur in an acid environment below pH 5.0. The ferrous iron arising in this reaction can be reoxidized to ferric iron by T. ferrooxidans or L. ferrooxidans and as such can take part in the oxidation process again. In indirect leaching the bacteria do not need to be in contact with the mineral surface.

The correct options are. B. Hydrometallurgy. D. Leaching. The principal ore of aluminium - bauxite - usually contains SiO2, iron oxides, and T iO2 as impurities. Concentration is carried out by digesting the powdered ore with a concentrated solution of N aOH at K and 35-36 bar pressure. Thus, Al2O3 is leached out as sodium aluminate

Iron oxide from bauxite residue (mainly haematite) is reduced to metallic iron in the region of cathodic potentials from –1.2 V to –1.4 V with a peak at –1.36 V. Hydrogen evolves at more negative potentials lower than –1.4 V. The plateau observed at cathodic potentials between –1.0 V and –1.2 V is attributed to reduction of haematite to magnetite which is always taking place
