## Frac Sand Mining 
Frac Sand Mining. Hydraulic fracturing uses high pressure water to break open underground geologic formations – most commonly shale. – containing oil and gas. Once the shale is fractured, if the fractures are not propped open, they will close again. So frackers use frack sand to prop open the fractures to allow the oil and gas to be extracted.

## Frac Sand Health and Environmental Impacts 
The sand keeps the cracks propped open so that oil and gas are released. Frac sand mining creates significant air pollution from the handling, mining, and processing of the sand. The important sources of air emissions come from the tiny dust particles – known as particulate matter – scattered during mining and processing.
