## Comminution and classification technologies of iron ore
01/01/2022Most of the high-grade hematite iron ores are typically subjected to simple dry processes of crushing and classification to meet the size specifications required for direct shipping ore (DSO). This involves multistages of crushing and screening to obtain lump (â31.5 + 6.3 mm) and fines (approximately â6.3 mm) products.

## chemical analysis of hematite iron ore 
Hematite is one of the most abundant minerals on Earth's surface and in the shallow crust. It is an iron oxide with a chemical composition of Fe 2 O 3. It is a common rock-forming mineral found in sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks at locations throughout the world. Hematite is the most important ore of iron.

## Exploitation and application of hematite in Russia
Hematite is a mineral, which contains a lot of iron, colored black to silver-gray, brown to reddish brown or red. It is mined as the main ore of iron. Varieties include kidney ore, martite (pseudo morphs after magnetite), iron rose and specularite (specular hematite). While the forms of hematite vary, they all have a rust-red streak.
