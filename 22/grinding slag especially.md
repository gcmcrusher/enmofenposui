13.10.2019For multiple vertical welding passes, especially when basic electrodes are used, you should weld so that slag pockets and undercut are minimized. While using the weaving technique, you should take care to prolong the dwell time slightly at the ends of the weave pattern. This will result in improved sidewall fusion as well as a flatter weld joint profile.

Phrase two: grinding. Crushed slag material will be sent to the storage hopper by the elevator, and then the feeder will send the material to the main mill for grinding. Phrase three: classifying. Ground slag powder will be classified; coarse powder will fall back to the main mill to be ground again. Phase four: production collecting.

## mill to grinding slag
When slag vertical grinding mill works, the process includes feeding, grinding, drying, collection and slag discharging. The process is reasonable and the system is compact. Moreover, the roller grinds materials directly on the grinding disc, which saves energy consumption by 30%-40% compared with the ball mill.
