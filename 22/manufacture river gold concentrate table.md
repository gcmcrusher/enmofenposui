01.05.2014Again, the answer is, it depends. If only a tiny amount of gold exists in a large quantity of black sand, the cost of extracting it can be much higher than the value of the gold itself.

## An overview of gold 
9.08.2022The annual worldwide production of gold is approximately 80 million troy ounces per year. There are 32.15 troy ounces in a kilogram. Gold has a specific gravity of 19.3, meaning that it is 19.3 times heavier than water. So gold weighs 19.3 kilograms per liter. A liter is a cube that measures 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) on a side.
