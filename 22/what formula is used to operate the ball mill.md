02.06.2017Ball mills use a tumbling process with stone or metal balls as the grinding materials to reduce the coarse material by means of impact and friction. Ball mills typically use water or other liquid and additives to help reduce friction and provide cooling during the grinding process. The feed enters one end of the ball mill, and discharges out the other end. Ball mills vary

If possible, it is highly recommended to use ball nose end mills on an incline () to avoid a "0" SFM condition at the center of the tool, thus increasing tool life and part finish (Figure 4). For ball nose optimization (and in addition to tilting the tool), it is highly recommended to feed the tool in

## Feed Rate Calculator 
When milling or drilling, or creating a tool path for a CNC machine the feed rate must be determined. Materials have rated surface speeds for a given type of cutter. The harder the material the slower the speed. Given the diameter of the tool and the surface speed, the RPMs of the spindle can be calculated.

IV. BALL MILLS Ball mills are one of the more common mills and use a closed cylindrical container that is rotated horizontally on its axis so that the media cascades. A typical ball mill has an L/D ratio of 1.5:1. Ball mills are filled with spheres or other shapes made of steel or ceramics; or with pebbles made of flint (or of an ore being ground).

The critical speed of ball mill is given by, where R = radius of ball mill; r = radius of ball. For R = 1000 mm and r = 50 mm, n c = 30.7 rpm. But the mill is operated at a speed of 15 rpm. Therefore, the mill is operated at 100 x 15/30.7 = 48.86 % of critical speed. If 100 mm dia balls are replaced by 50 mm dia balls, and the other conditions

## Ball milling 
A device used to reduce the particle size of materials, bodies or glazes. A ball mill is simply a container that is filled with pebbles (either of porcelain or stones e.g. Flint) into which a charge (powder or slurry) is put and that is then mechanically rotated to cause the tumbling pebbles to crush particles that happen between them.
