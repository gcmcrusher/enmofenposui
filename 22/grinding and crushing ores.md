Crushing and grinding are the two primary comminution processes. Crushing is normally carried out on run-of-mine ore, while grinding (normally carried out after crushing) may be conducted on dry or slurried material. In comminution, the size reduction of particles is done by three types of forces: compression, impact and attrition. Read More
