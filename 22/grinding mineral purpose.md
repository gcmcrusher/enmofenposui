03.12.2012Minerals such as aluminum oxides, and silicon carbide make up 80 to 90 percent of the minerals produced in the United States. Diamonds are thought to be extracted more because of their many uses such as cutting, shaping, and grinding. Synthetic diamonds are also being produced to grind carbides and ceramics, but are worth a lot less than natural diamonds. The

## Grinding Classification Circuits 
The purpose of a grinding mill is to convert electrical energy into rock breakage. The best use of that asset is to try to maximize the power draw. Try to hold the mill speed high and vary the feed rate to hold the weight (or bearing pressure), but watch out for cycling or surging that indicates instability in the charge. It is not easy

02.06.2017Mineral sizers are one of the newer technologies to the crushing industry. They feature two rotors, each fixed with large teeth that rotate in opposite directions at low speeds. The material to be crushed is fed onto the rotors and is gripped and then crushed between the teeth. When sufficiently reduced, the crushed material falls between the rotors and exits from the
