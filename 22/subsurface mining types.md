## What Are The Methods Of Subsurface Mining? 
19.04.2022Subsurface mining is a mining method in which soil and rocks are removed to reach underlying coal or minerals. Besides, there are other three processes too, decline access, adits access, and ore access. There are four main mining methods: Surface mining (above the ground) and subsurface mining (below the ground).

Surface mining. It has been estimated that more than two-thirds of the world's yearly mineral production is extracted by surface mining. There are several types of surface mining, but the three most common are open-pit mining, strip mining, and quarrying.These differ from one another in the mine geometries created, the techniques used, and the minerals produced.
