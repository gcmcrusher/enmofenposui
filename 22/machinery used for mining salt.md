Miners use a method called room and pillar mining to get salt from the deposit. They use explosives and large machinery to blast out large chambers from the solid rock salt. If they remove too much salt, the mine could collapse. So engineers make sure to leave behind gigantic pillars of salt. The pillars support the weight of the rock above.
