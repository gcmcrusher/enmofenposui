## Froth flotation: a quick overview 
Dear readers, After leaving you hanging for a while, I am now ready to talk about froth flotation as minerals process technology. As I have already revealed in my first blog "Finnish wood", the idea of the project is the development of new cellulose-based chemicals, having selective affinity towards selected minerals surfaces, thus behaving as efficient collectors.

## Preparation of Ceramic Glaze Waste for Recycling using Froth Flotation 
It is theorized that froth flotation can be used to exploit surface chemistry differences between frit and pigment in waste glaze and obtain separation between the components. In this way components from glaze could be separated, purified and reused in the process. One goal from this research is to develop a quick method of determining if a system lends itself to froth

## Frothers 
Frothing, also known as froth flotation, is the process of selectively separating hydrophobic valuable minerals from hydrophilic waste gangue. In its simplest form, froth flotation is a method whereby minerals can be "skimmed" from the surface of "slurry" that is "foamed" with the assistance of specific chemicals, water and air bubbles. In mineral processing, frothers are

Conversely, it is possible to float waste rock (mainly silica) with cationic reagents (positively charged heads) if the basicity is kept high (pH 11-12) and other organic depressants, such as starch or synthetic organic polymers, are added to prevent the iron oxide from floating. This is commonly referred to as 'reverse' flotation. Normally silica is floated using an amine as the

20.07.2022Froth flotation machine is generally used for the concentration of sulphide ores. The principle behind froth flotation process is that sulphide ores are preferentially wetted by pine oil whereas gangue articles are wetted by water. In this process, the suspension of a powdered ore is made with water. Collectors like pine oil, fatty acids and
