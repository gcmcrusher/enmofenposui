06.06.2014The present disclosure includes systems and methods for solving speckle problems by exciting the screen with a more complex vibration spectrum. A range of frequencies provides, in effect, a collection of overlapping patterns of high and low displacement, so that all regions of the screen have enough motion to reduce visible speckle. As

## 1. Reasons for the blockage of the vibrating screen 
Occurrence, this can better make the screen work properly. The specific method is: to make the tension hook into a constant tension mechanism, that is, install a spring on the tension bolt, so as to avoid the phenomenon of blocking the holes of the vibrating screen, and improve the screening effect, so that the vibrating screen can be screened

## Factors Affect The Reliability Of Vibrating Screen
First, because the working condition of a vibrating screen is severe, so the choosing of material to make a vibrating screen means a lot, especially for the key parts. But the quality of materials in the present market is intermingled, so manufacturers should choose raw material with high quality to make the vibrating screen and check the material chose.
