## conveyor: Conveyor Selection Guide 
07/10/2009The location of the site where the conveyor is to be installed may be in a cold, mountainous area. In this case (assuming ambient temperatures drop to well below freezing), special consideration must be given to the selection of the conveyor belt as well as to items such as the mechanical components (bearings) and the lubricant proposed.

## Advantages of Pneumatic Conveyors vs. Mechanical
Even notwithstanding the possibility of part failure, the individual maintenance and inspection of all the working components of mechanical conveyors drive up the cost of operation. Pneumatic conveyors break down into only a few key working parts: an air compressor or vacuum pump, an in-feed device, piping or tubing for transference, and a separating device.
