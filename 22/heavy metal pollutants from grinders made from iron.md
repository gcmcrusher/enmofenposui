17.12.2016Heavy metal pollution is caused when such metals as arsenic, cobalt, copper, cadmium, lead, silver and zinc contained in excavated rock or exposed in an underground mine come in contact with water. Metals are leached out and carried downstream as water washes over the rock surface. Although metals can become mobile in neutral pH conditions, leaching

## Are metal shavings dangerous? 
Metal shavings that are produced when oil containers or cans are opened are commonly soaked in oil. These are a fire hazard when strewn about or disposed of carelessly. Contact with sparks and/or electrical outlets can ignite them, initiating large fires. Titanium metal shavings, in particular, are a significant fire hazard.

## Introduction to Heavy Metal Monitoring 
A heavy metal is a member of an ill-defined subset of chemical elements that exhibit metallic properties. Many different definitions of the term heavy metal have been proposed, based on either density, atomic number, atomic weight, chemical properties or toxicity. The heavy metals which are monitored by CEH include:
