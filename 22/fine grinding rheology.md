This chapter focuses on wet grinding behavior involved with slurry rheology changes and is based on two types of experiments run on a variety of materials. The first involved determining in a batch laboratory mill the net production of material smaller than some size—for example, kg/hr of 75 μm—as an index of mill production in a standard batch mill test.

Glossary. Stress Relaxation (Rheology) Relaxation When a constant strain is applied to a rubber compound, the force necessary to maintain that strain is not constant but decreases with time; this behavior is known as stress relaxation. The process responsible for stress relaxation can be physical or chemical, and under normal conditions, both will occur at the same time.

## Techniques in oscillatory shear rheology 
The rheology of the emulsions is strongly inﬂuenced by the st ate of ﬂoccula-tion [9]. Unﬂocculated or weakly ﬂocculated emulsions show a crossover point be-tween G′ and G′′. This crossover frequency is associated with a characteristic re-laxation time for the onset of the terminal or ﬂow region for t he emulsion. Highly

Introduction It is generally observed that dry and wet grinding of materials in tumbling ball mills to very fine sizes can lead to the slowing down of the overall grinding process (Austin et al., 1984; Frances and Laguerie, 1998; Yekeler et al., 2001).

## Most common problems in thickener operations (part 1)
When the content of fine particles (clays or micas) increases more than 20% above their normal value, due to their high specific surface, problems of excessive increase in rheology are generated e.g. viscosity and shear stress increase making thickening difficult. Mine planning is necessary to control the fines content under the specified values in the design.
