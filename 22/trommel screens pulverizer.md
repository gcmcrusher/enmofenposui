## Screens 
A European influence on screens is the horizontal trommel, as opposed to the inclined trommel, a design that seeks to increase contact time of material on the screen, and hence throughput.

One of the biggest disadvantages of the trommel screen's design is the inability to replace part of the drum when damage occurs.
