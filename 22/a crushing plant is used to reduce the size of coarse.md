## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency 
13/05/2019Setting jaw crushers. Ideally, the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6-to-1. There are different ways to calculate reduction ratio, but the best way is something called the P80 factor. The reduction ratio is then calculated by comparing the input feed size passing 80 percent versus the discharge size that passes 80 percent.

The geological grade of the ore deposit is relatively high (about 50%), but the ore body is thinner or has more interlayers. The waste rock is mixed in during mining to dilute the ore. For this kind of ore, only crushing and no-grinding can be used so coarse-grained tailings are discarded through re-election to recover the geological grade.
