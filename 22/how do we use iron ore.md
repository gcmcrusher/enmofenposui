## Iron ore: supplying high
Iron ore is Australia's largest source of export revenue, worth $117 billion (approximately US$85 billion) in 2017. While the price of iron ore has been moderating some of the growth in export revenue in recent years, the volume of Australia's iron ore exports is continuing to grow, albeit at lower rates. In 2020 shipments of iron ore from Australia increased by 31 million

12/05/2021Many ore-forming systems are accompanied by different kinds of alteration (for example potassic or argillic alteration) that are not too hard to see in the field. Once you see them, there is a possibility that an ore deposit is nearby. Other surface methods include, among others, looking at rivers sediments.

## Iron ore 
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or

98% of all iron ore mined, mostly Fe2O3 with a very little Fe3O4, is used to produce pig iron, and 99% of pig iron is used to produce steel (the other 1% being used to produce various irons – cast iron, wrought iron, etc.). So, 97% of all iron ore is used to make steel. If you want to know how the iron ore becomes steel, just ask me!
