19.06.2015The approximate horsepower HP of a mill can be calculated from the following equation: HP = (W) (C) (Sin a) (2π) (N)/ 33000. where: W = weight of charge. C = distance of centre of gravity or charge from centre of mill in feet. a = dynamic angle of repose of the charge. N = mill speed in RPM. HP = A x B x C x L.

## Useful Information on Air
An Air-Operated Double-Diaphragm pump (AODD) is a type of positive displacement (PD) pump. It consists of two pumping chambers that are alternately filled and discharged by the movement of flexible diaphragms. Compressed air is alternately fed to, and vented from, air chambers on the opposite sides of the diaphragms to create the pumping action.
