Hafnium is a chemical component with the symbol Hf and atomic number 72. A shiny, silvery gray, tetravalent conversion metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in zirconium minerals. Its survival was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Hafnium was the second-to-last element of those with stable isotopes to be discovered.
