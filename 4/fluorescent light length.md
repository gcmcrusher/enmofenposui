## Introduction to Fluorescent Proteins 
Kindling fluorescent protein does not exhibit emission until illuminated with green light. Low-intensity light results in a transient red fluorescence that decays over a few minutes (see the mitochondria in Figure 6(c)). Illumination with blue light quenches the kindled fluorescence immediately, allowing tight control over fluorescent labeling.
