## New Developments in Attritors 
Mar 26, 2001The attritor, or stirred ball mill, is a grinding mill containing internally agitated media. There are quite a few types of attritors; they can be categorized as dry grind, wet grind, regular speed (to 400 rpm) and high speed (400–1,800 rpm) attritors. A useful and simple equation describing the grinding momentum is M x V (mass x velocity

## Nano Grinding Mills Methods — When Smallest is Best
Fortunately, industry demand for very fine, dry powder materials is driving innovations in dry milling methods. Fluidized bed jet mills are a good candidate for nano grinding, because fluidization prevents the dry material from agglomerating. Jet milling with superheated steam enables nano-range particle sizes while also drying the feed material.
