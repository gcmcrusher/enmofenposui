## how is pyrite mined and processed 
Pyrite is common in coal deposits, but burning coal that contains pyrite releases sulfur, which combines with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide, an air pollutant. The exposure of pyrite to air during mining may also result in acid mine drainage. Because pyrite occurs in many kinds of rocks, care must be taken when mining limestone for concrete.

AMD is generated by the oxidation of pyrite and marcasite in coal mining activities (Kim and Chon 2001; Zhao et al.2007, Doulati Ardejani et al.2008 and 2010). Pyrite oxidation rate depends on tem-perature, pH, acidophilic Fe organisms, humidity and the availability of oxygen in the coal refuse pile, which is mainly controlled by diffusion process.
