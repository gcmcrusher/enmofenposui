## Gold recovery from refractory gold concentrates by pressure oxidation 
Due to the depletion of high-grade gold ores with large-scale gold ore mining, the attention of gold production enterprises is switching towards refractory gold ores gradually (Karamanev et al., 2001; Zhu et al., 2012). There are two reasons for refractory of gold: (a) The content of organic carbon in the ores is higher and carbon could be enriched in the flotation process. The higher

Flotation of Gold Ores 17.1 INTRODUCTION (CIL, resin-in-pulp), bio-oxidation, etc. All of these processes are well documented in the literature [1,2] and abundantly described. However, very little is known about the flotation properties of gold contained in various ores and the sulphides that carry gold.

A method for suppressing the oxidation of sulfide minerals in a sulfide ore, which comprises adding an antioxidant containing an organic acid having a carboxyl group as a primary component and also containing a vegetable polyphenol to the sulfide ore accumulated in a stock pile or an accumulation spot for waste stones. The method allows the suppression of the oxidation of

03.08.2022Chile is the world's top copper producer (27% of global production) and exporter. In Chile, copper is mostly found in sulfide ores, especially in chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), bornite (Cu 5 FeS 4) and chalcocite (Cu 2 S). The continual exploitation of ore reserves leads to the necessity of mining ores from deeper parts of deposits, often with increasing mineralogical complexity.

## How oxidation affects selective flotation of complex sulphide ores
29.11.2013Oxidation is one of the most important factors. The oxidation of complex sulphide ore is found to be enhanced by the presence of pyrite. Pyritic complex sulphide ore sometimes behaves like elemental sulphur in flotation. Such troublesome behaviour is often experienced for flotation systems in which the natural pH of the. pulp is low.
