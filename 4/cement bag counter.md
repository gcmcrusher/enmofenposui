## CSA Cements in Concrete Countertops: Strength Low Carbon 
Low Carbon Footprint. Another key advantage is that CSA cements are also significantly greener. Portland cement is fired in kilns at temperatures of around 1500C (2700F), whereas CSA cements only need to be fired at temperatures of around 1250C (2250F). The resulting CSA clinker is softer than OPC clinker, requiring less energy to grind.
