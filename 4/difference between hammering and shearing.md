17.04.2020Forstner Bits. These bits cut clean, accurate flat-bottomed holes in larger diameters. The lipped edges shear material to cleanly define a hole's edge and the center point makes it simple to locate the hole's center. Due to the force needed to make the cut, Forstner bits are best used in a drill press or brace. Common sizes: 5‚ÅÑ16"- 2".

## Hammering and Forging Safety Guidelines 
Safety Precautions to Use. Wear eye protection when hammering. Hearing protection is essential. Change your posture and working height now and then. Take breaks every forty-five minutes or so and do something different now and then. Do not use your wrist much when hammering; use your elbow sparingly, your shoulder most.

## Shearing Stress 
More About Shearing Stress. The meaning of shear is 'to cut off'. When the force applies over the surface area of a rigid body (a force acting in a direction parallel to the surface), then this force will try to cut off one part of the body from the other. Due to this, the body is deformed and thus it produces strain (shear strain- the
