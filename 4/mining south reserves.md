## The South African mining sector 
Despite this abundance in natural mineral resources, South African mining faces a systemic crisis. Local gold production has collapsed from 605 tonnes in 1994 to 133 tonnes (22% of it) in 2014, despite a 218% boom in the gold price during this time and South African gold reserves still ranked No 1 internationally (by value US$151bn).

## MINING IN AFRICA 
04 | Mining in Africa INTRODUCTION The future is bright for mining in Africa. Over 30% of the world's global mineral reserves are found in Africa, yet less than 5% of the total global mineral exploration and extraction budget is invested in the continent. The potential for a burgeoning mining industry across these two emerging regions is immense.
