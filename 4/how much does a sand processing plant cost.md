## Sand Dunes – Coastal Care
Dunes commonly begin as piles of sand accumulated in the lee of beach debris such as piles of seaweed (especially Sargassum ), clumps of salt marsh straw, and a host of human refuse (fishing nets, bottles, timbers) (Figs. 3.2 and 3.3). Beach debris slows down the wind or blocks it, causing sand to accumulate in the wind "shadow" of the object.
