## Align Technology
In 1997, five employees in a small duplex in Redwood City, California, founded Align Technology with a simple concept in mind - how to leverage technology to straighten teeth. Just a few years later in 1999, Align Technology pioneered the invisible orthodontics market with the introduction of the Invisalign system and soon launched a large U.S national advertising campaign.

## Horizontal vs Vertical Milling: What's the Difference?
While vertical milling machines usually have long and thin cutting tools, horizontal milling machines have shorter and thicker cutting tools. Horizontal milling machines are able to perform heavier, deeper cuts than vertical milling machines. As a result, manufacturing companies often use them to cut grooves or slots into workpieces.

## Milling (machining) 
Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.

## Horizontal vs Vertical Milling: What's the Difference?
22.08.2019While vertical milling machines usually have long and thin cutting tools, horizontal milling machines have shorter and thicker cutting tools. Horizontal milling machines are able to perform heavier, deeper cuts than vertical milling machines. As a result, manufacturing companies often use them to cut grooves or slots into workpieces.
