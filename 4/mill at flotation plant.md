## Flotation Speration Plant of Copper Ore
Common flotation process: raw ore → primary crushing → secondary crushing → feeding → ball milling → classification → flotation → concentration → drying → copper concentrate. 1. The mined ore will be first crushed by the jaw crusher, and then secondly crushed by the jaw crusher/impact crusher/cone crusher. 2.
