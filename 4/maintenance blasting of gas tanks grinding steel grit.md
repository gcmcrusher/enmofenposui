When a sufficiently hard abrasive particle strikes steel, it deforms the surface into a valley and pushes up peaks. The distance between the top of the peak and the bottom of the valley is known as the depth profile. In the U.S., the depth profile is measured by mils – thousandths of an inch.In the metric system, the micron(one millionth of a meter) is used.
