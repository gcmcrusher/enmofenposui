Crushed phosphate rock from line 26 is introduced to reactor 24 wherein it is mixed with dilute phosphoric acid which is recycled from the process through line 28. Reactor 24 is equipped with a stirrer and the slurry is mixed for a time period sufficient to convert the phosphorus values in the rock to mono calcium phosphate.
