Redox catalysis in a ball mill Mixing solid reactants in a ball mill is a promising means of avoiding the copious solvent waste associated with most chemical syntheses. Kubota et al. now report that adding a piezoelectric catalyst to the mix can promote bond formation through apparent electron transfer cycles (see the Perspective by Xia and Wang).

## Ball Milling The Role of Media and Bead Mills 
Ball milling is a grinding technique that uses media to effectively break down pigment agglomerates and aggregates to their primary particles. Using a rotor or disc impeller to create collisions of the grinding media, the impact and force created by the bead mills collisions break down the pigment agglomerates.
