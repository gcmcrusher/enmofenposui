## High ph and home depot gravel 
05.11.2010As an experiment, put some tap water in a clean bucket and try measuring its pH before and after letting it sit for a few days. Excessive carbon dioxide in the water, from the water being under pressure in pipes, can lower the pH. Once the tap water is 'free', it loses the CO2 and the pH rises. This may be the case with your water.
