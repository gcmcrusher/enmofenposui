Since hot food and drinks are often set on a table, a heat-resistant epoxy resin is necessary for a final coat. Epoxy Temperature Limits. Your basic DIY epoxy can withstand low amounts of heat, but anything between 20C to 90C (68 -195 Fahrenheit) will begin to cause a change in the molecular structure and the epoxy will soften and cause distortion.
