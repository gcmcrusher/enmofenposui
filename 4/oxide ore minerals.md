## Iron Ore Statistics and Information 
Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores 
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively,

## Differences Between Sulfides And Oxides 
Sulfides are minerals that contain sulfur. These minerals are inorganic compounds, which means that they are formed through geological rather than biological processes. These minerals are commonly found in soils with a higher temperature. Oxides are those minerals that contain oxide anions, or oxygen, with ice and quartz being the exceptions.
