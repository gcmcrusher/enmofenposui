## Chemical composition structure of high chromium ball
At present, most of the grinding media used in cement industry are high-chromium balls. With the continuous development of cement grinding technology, the specific surface area and fineness of cement are required to be even higher. As a cement company, the correct selection of grinding materials is particularly important.
