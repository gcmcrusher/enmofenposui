## The Dangerous Effects of Illegal Mining 
04.04.2017Negative effects of illegal mining on the environment and human health. Most mining activities are extremely high-risk for not only the environment, but also those who do the actual physical labor. The environmental risks of mining include: the formation of sinkholes. the contamination of soil and groundwater.
