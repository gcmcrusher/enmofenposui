Since the implicit filter and floating projection constraints of design variables are imposed outside the optimizer, MMA can be tentatively employed. To improve the stability and convergence of the MMA optimizer for topology optimization, the lower and upper bounds of the asymptotes are restricted by −0.01 and 1.01, respectively.

## [PDF] Flotation stabilization and optimization 
01.11.2003The control of flotation plants is by no means trivial. Flotation is one of the most interactive mineralsi? processing operations. The interactive nature of flotation circuits results in oscillations of levels and hence of grades and recoveries. Also, poor level setpoint tracking and disturbances have negative influences on grades and recoveries. The result is an unstable

## Flotation Plant Optimisation
Flotation Plant Optimisation. Flotation circuits play a key role in determining the profitability of base metal concentrators many companies have recognized this and have opted to install complex control systems that are designed to optimize performance based on one or more objective functions such as circuit yield grade or other measures of efficiency or cost.

## Flotation Circuit 
The purpose of a Flotation circuit is to concentrate feed ore to the desired metal grade as efficiently as possible, minimising waste and loss of the desired metal in the process. Achieving throughput, grade and recovery targets presents a challenge as operators are limited by a reactive and manual approach (i.e. responding to the appearance of the froth) that is

## Optimizing Flotation Dryer Operation 
01.10.2001Optimization of an air flotation dryer system requires that other process demands be considered in conjunction with any reduction in operating costs. Therefore, the complicated relationship between the dryer and the emissions control device (i.e., the oxidizer) also must be taken into consideration when optimizing systems processes.
