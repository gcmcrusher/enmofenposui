## Foundry Sand Wash Plants 
The most common casting process used in the foundry industry is the sand cast system. Virtually all sand cast moulds for ferrous castings are of the green sand type. Green sand consists of high-quality silica sand, bentonite clay (as the binder), water and coal (a carbonaceous mould additive to improve casting finish).

## The Manufacturing Process 
The No-Bake Sand casting process involves creating a mold using sand and resin. Sand is packed around a pattern that contains the imprint of the casting to create a cope (top half of sand mold) and drag (bottom half of sand mold). Molten metal is poured into the sand mold, through the runner and gating system and allowed to cool and solidify.

Sand casting is widely used for centuries because of the simplicity of the process. The sand casting process involves the following basic steps: (a) place a wooden or metallic pattern in sand to create a mold, (b) fit in the pattern and sand in a gating system, (c) remove the pattern, (d) fill the mold cavity with molten metal, (e) allow the

20/07/2018The green sand process utilizes a mold made of compressed or compacted moist sand packed around a wood or metal pattern. The term "green" denotes the presence of moisture in the molding sand, and indicates that the mold is not baked or dried. The mold material consists of silica sand mixed with a suitable bonding agent (usually clay) and
