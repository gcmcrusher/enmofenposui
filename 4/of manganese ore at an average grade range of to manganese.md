Manganese is the 4th most used metal on earth in terms of tonnage, behind iron, aluminum and copper. It has numerous applications, including objects made of steel, portable batteries, or aluminium beverage cans. In each case manganese plays a vital role in improving the properties of the alloys and compounds involved in each specific application.
