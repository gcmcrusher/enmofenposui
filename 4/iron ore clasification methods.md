## Iron Ore Mining 
MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two categories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.

## Iron ore 
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or

ISO 2597-2:2015 specifies a titrimetric method, free from mercury pollution, for the determination of total iron content in iron ores, using potassium dichromate as titrant after reduction of the iron(III) by tin(II) chloride and titanium(III) chloride. The excess reductant is then oxidized by either dilute potassium dichromate.
