## Grinding Safety Precautions And Regulations
06.08.2022In addition, the distance between the grinding wheel and the adjustable tongue guard — also known as a "spark arrestor" — must never exceed 1/4-inch. To make sure your grinder complies with OSHA's 1910.215 regulation and ANSI standards, you should use a grinder safety gauge.

Cryogenic grinding of plant and animal tissue is a technique used by microbiologists. Samples that require extraction of nucleic acids must be kept at −80 C or lower during the entire extraction process. For samples that are soft or flexible at room temperature, cryogenic grinding may be the only viable technique for processing samples. [2]

The purpose of the usual grinding process in grain milling is the production of grit, dust and flour by reducing the size of the cereal grain and by separating the kernel representing the flour portion of the grain from the shell envelope in order to extract the important components which contain the physiologically nutritious values, namely starch and albumen, and to separate these latter
