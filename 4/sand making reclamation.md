Discharged sand is 85ᵒF (29.4ᵒC) The Thermfire's unique stacked design offers a small footprint. Other machines have multiple stages and can take up 2 to 3 times as much space to achieve the same throughput. The relatively low thermal mass of the Thermfire allows us to achieve processing temperatures from a cold start in 25 minutes.

## Sand Reclamation 
Sand reclamation allows for sustainable use of a finite natural resource. For the average foundry, casting processes can produce around 8,000 tonnes of waste sand – which, without intervention, will end up in landfills. It isn't easy for foundries to reuse sand in-house. After a certain number of casting cycles, the sand will be physically
