## How is Steel Made? 
At the most basic, steel is made by mixing carbon and iron at very high temperatures (above 2600F). Primary steelmaking creates steel from a product called "pig iron.". Pig iron is smelted iron, from ore, which contains more carbon than is correct for steel. The steelmaker uses a system that bubbles oxygen through melting pig iron.
