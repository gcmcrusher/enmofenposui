## Vibration Monitoring 
The Department of Environment and Conservation's (DEC) Assessing Vibration: a technical guideline (2006) provides guideline values for continuous, transient and intermittent events that are based on a Vibration Dose Value (VDV) rather than a continuous vibration level. The VDV is dependent upon the level and duration of the vibration event

## Piping Vibration Risks and Integrity Assessment 
This article provides advice for owners planning to implement a Piping Vibration and Integrity Assessment (also referred to as a Piping Vibration Audit). This service is based on the Energy Institute's 2008 Guideline, Avoidance of vibration induced fatigue failure in process pipework (AVIFF). Piping Risks in Onshore and Offshore Facilities

## CHAPTER 17: AIRBLAST AND VIBRATION 
• Assessing Vibration: a technical guideline (DEC 2006) 17.1.1 Blasting Criteria Ground vibration and airblast are potential effects of blasting. Ground vibration from blasting is due to the movement of mechanical energy within the rock mass or soil. Airblast is the pressure wave produced by the blast and transmitted through the air.

The aim of the risk assessment is to help you decide what you need to do to ensure the health and safety of your employees who are exposed to vibration. Identify where there might be a risk from vibration and who is likely to be affected; Contain a reasonable estimate of your employees' exposures, and; Identify what you need to do to comply

Section 12 of the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (EP Act) says: 'Noise includes vibration of any frequency, whether emitted through air or another medium.' That is, for the purposes of assessing impacts, noise includes any vibrations through the air, water, and/or the ground. Furthermore, it is not only the audible effects that are
