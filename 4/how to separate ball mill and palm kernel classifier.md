20.01.2021Froth flotation, as pointed out previously, was a part of the evolution of milling during the first quarter of the 20th century—a period during which the progress of milling was greater than in all of its previous history. It marks the passing of the stamp battery, after 400 years service to the mining industry, and the beginning of grinding with rod mills, ball mills, and

Palm and palm kernel oils consist many of glycerides and like other oils in their crude form from many consist of small and variable portions of non-glyceride components as well. The aim of palm kernel oil refining is therefore to convert the crude oil to quality edible oil by removing objectionable impurities to desired levels in th most efficient manner.

## Why do we need separate kernel stack for each process?
A separate kernel stack is needed for each process to save the state of the process. The state needs to be saved in case a task switch is performed, i.e. the current process is put to sleep, and some other process scheduled to run.

Then we simply use a linear classifier on the new (higher dimensional) feature vectors, pretending that they were the original input vectors.

30.07.2018In last week's blog post we got our feet wet by implementing a simple object tracking algorithm called "centroid tracking". Today, we are going to take the next step and look at eight separate object tracking algorithms built right into OpenCV!. You see, while our centroid tracker worked well, it required us to run an actual object detector on each frame of the input video.
