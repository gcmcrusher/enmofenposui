## gold processing 
Gold can be freed from these ores or concentrates by treating them with various oxidizing processes. The most common method is to roast gold-bearing minerals at temperatures of 450 to 750 C (840 to 1,380 F) to destroy the interfering sulfides. Oxidation can also be accomplished by the use of high-pressure reactors called autoclaves, in

## Gold cyanidation 
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.. Production of reagents for mineral processing to recover gold represents more

## 25.2 Extracting ores 
Rocks with large concentrations of minerals, are called ores. Mining depends on finding good quality ore, preferably within a small area. The next step is to get the rocks which contain the mineral out of the ground. Once the ore is on the surface, the process of getting the mineral you want out of the rock can start.
