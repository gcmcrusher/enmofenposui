Solution Mining - When conventional underground mines become flooded and unworkable, potash can be extracted using solution mining. Water is injected as a brine or salt and water solution. It is then circulated throughout the mine workings to dissolve potash and salt from the original pillars and walls. The brine is pumped to an evaporation pond.
