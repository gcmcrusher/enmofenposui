Step 1: Wetting. The first step to wet grinding is eliminating air from the surface of the raw feed, so that each individual particle is fully in contact with the liquid slurry. Ensuring complete contact is vital for effective milling. This requires a liquid with lower surface tension than the free surface energy of the solid.
