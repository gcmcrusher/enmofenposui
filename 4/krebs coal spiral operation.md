Spiral separators of the wet type, also called spiral concentrators, are devices to separate solid components in a slurry, based upon a combination of the solid particle density as well as the particle's hydrodynamic properties (e.g. drag).The device consists of a tower, around which is wound a sluice, from which slots or channels are placed in the base of

Orbit Simulator. An interactive demonstration of an orbit. The above demo shows how a body behaves when under the influence of the gravity of a much more massive object. In our example, we have chosen this to be a moon orbiting a planet, but it could equally be a planet orbiting a star. You can click anywhere on the demo to reposition the moon.

Krebs Coal Spirals are used to make density-based separations on nominal 14M x 100M (1.19mm x 0.149mm) size coal. These devices consist of a 0.96-meter helix with between 2 and 3.25 turns, mounted on a 160-mm center column. To provide greater capacity per volume, either two (duplex) or three (triplex) helices can be mounted on one center column.

## An Engineering/Economic Analysis of Coal Preparation Plant Operation 
Since there is normally a comparable volume of horsepower in the balance of the preparation plant, the overall electricity cost will be roughly $ 0.18 to $ 0.20 per ton of clean coal. If the electric rate was $ 0.05 per kwh, then this cost could be as high as $ 0.23 per ton.

## Separation Density 
Some coal losses may take place through the apex because larger coal particles are classified. These losses can be eliminated using a two-stage circuitry where losses are recleaned in coal spirals. Combined with a second-stage spiral circuit, the system can provide a separation density from 1.65 to 2.00 SG.

## Coal preparation plant 
Coal needs to be stored at various stages of the preparation process, and conveyed around the CPP facilities. Coal handling is part of the larger field of bulk material handling, and is a complex and vital part of the CPP.. Stockpiles provide surge capacity to various parts of the CPP. ROM coal is delivered with large variations in production rate of tonnes per hour (tph).
