05.09.2019The sequential pattern mining algorithm (SPM) searches for frequent patterns in sequence databases. A sequence database consists of ordered elements or events. For example, a customer first buys bread, then eggs and cheese, and then milk. This forms a sequence consisting of three ordered events.

Aug 04, 2022three-way pattern mining methods [34, 35] were proposed, which categorize the events into three levels of interest: strong, medium, and weak interest, and patterns are composed of strong and medium interest events. Thus, the mined patterns are more concerned by users. Inspired by three-way pattern mining, three-way ONP mining is worth exploring.

## A Lean Implementation Framework for the Mining Industry
Lean implementation in the mining industry in a comprehensive and structured way. This paper therefore follows a systematic approach to review the current literature to identify Lean implementation patterns in the mining sector, its scope, challenges, and limitations. The results reveal the limited utilisation of Lean

## Pattern Mining 
Graph Pattern Mining. Graph pattern mining is the mining of frequent subgraphs (also called (sub)graph patterns) in one or a set of graphs. Methods for mining graph patterns can be categorized into Apriori-based and pattern growthâ€“based approaches. Alternatively, we can mine the set of closed graphs where a graph g is closed if there exists

## Frequent Pattern (FP) Growth Algorithm In Data Mining
16.07.2022Let us see the steps followed to mine the frequent pattern using frequent pattern growth algorithm: #1) The first step is to scan the database to find the occurrences of the itemsets in the database. This step is the same as the first step of Apriori. The count of 1-itemsets in the database is called support count or frequency of 1-itemset.
