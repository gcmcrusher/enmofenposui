The coal sample was made into particles by using a sealed laboratory sample grinder. Five standard screens with apertures of 3 mm, 1 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.2 mm, and 0.074 mm were used to screen the crushed coal samples. The coal samples with the particle size of 1 ∼ 3 mm were used as coal particles containing gas in the crushing experiment. The 0.2
