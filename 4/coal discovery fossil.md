## What is coal where is it found? 
Coal is a fossil fuel, formed from vegetation, which has been consolidated between other rock strata and altered by the combined effects of pressure and heat over millions of years to form coal seams. The energy we get from coal today comes from the energy that plants absorbed from the sun millions of years ago.

## Fossil fuel reserves: When will we run out of oil, gas and coal?
06.12.2015It's possible to make oil or gas out of coal and there's still a lot of coal left. However, once oil and later on gas are finished, we'll be using up coal much faster than anticipated because coal will then have to replace oil and gas as a fuel, unless we discover other means to replace fossil fuels, such as renewable energy.One thing is certain: We will run out of cheap

Lyell was delighted with his discovery with Dawson of "Coal Age reptiles" largely because it provided him with evidence in his long-standing campaign against the proponents of catastrophism, who argued that reptiles did not succeed fishes in the fossil record until the Mesozoic Era of dinosaurs. The true significance of these earliest reptiles at Joggins has only

The rapidity of ammonite evolution is the single most important reason for their superiority over other fossils for the purposes of correlation. Such correlation can be on a worldwide scale. Ammonites can be used to distinguish intervals of geological time of less than 200 000 years' duration. In terms of Earth history, this is very precise.
