## Crushing in Mineral Processing
26.12.2015In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate

Mineral processing faces intrinsically complicated processes and recirculating loads. Production can often be disturbed by unexpected events and recurrent maintenance operations. Today's mines must also process more complex ores due to declining ore grades. All of this adds up to complicated process operations. We can provide a better way.

• Carbothermic reduction of iron ore (Hametite) in blast furnace is a well known process. Overall process is written as: • Ironore oxide mineral + gangue + Reducer (C) + flux + hot blast oxygen enriched air = Pig iron (liquid) + Slag (liquid) + waste gas (CO,CO2,N2) • Iron ore contains Fe2O3, along with gangue materials such as SiO2, Al2O3.
