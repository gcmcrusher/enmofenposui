09.07.2014And now you can, because Dixon is selling this very rock-crawler for $72,000 (the extra $22k derives from the cost of the original Excursion on which it's based). Over the years he's built 75 other machines with no two exactly alike. This, however, is the only one currently for sale, and features a Ford V-10 engine, a 44-gallon fuel tank and gets a 11 mpg at 75 mph.

## Ford 10 Speed Transmission Problems 
31.03.2020There are two class actions in play at the moment as people try to come to terms with Chevy 10 speed transmission problems. One of these is the brainwork of a Pennsylvania driver regarding the ten-speed design in F 150s. The driver states that the model in play is defective such that it shifts erratically.

18.07.2015That Rock Crusher is only going to steal about a third of your bhp and torque! I'd challenge anyone to make the distinction based on post-install performance, and in front of that tranny, between a 390 and 360, both of which were massively anemic compared the the 402/396 running in their contemporaneous GM counter-parts.

The Muncie 4 Speed in it's original form was NOT a whisper quiet transmission, therefore, you may experience some whine or gear sound with these units. If you want silence, try some of the new fancy 5 or six speeds on the market. These are good, solid Muncie 4 speeds that look, work and sound as the originals.

22.01.2014Ford 300 I6 engines have been known to last up to 300,000 miles with no major issues. They produce gobs of low-end torque, including an impressive 265 ft.-lbs. of torque in some instances. That has made the Ford 300 I6, particularly the versions with a forged crank and high-flow exhaust manifold, a popular choice for heavy-duty commercial trucks.

One of the complaints we hear about now and then is a 4 speed transmission that "locked up" when it was shifted from one gear to another. The transmission is actually engaged in 2 gears at once. It can be several combinations, but 2nd and reverse seem popular. First, is the "why" it happened and the answer is simple.
