## How Cement Is Made
Concrete is formed when portland cement creates a paste with water that binds with sand and rock to harden. Cement is manufactured through a closely controlled chemical combination of calcium, silicon, aluminum, iron and other ingredients. Common materials used to manufacture cement include limestone, shells, and chalk or marl combined with

## The Differences Between Cement, Concrete, and Mortar
30.11.2021Cement is a fine binding powder that is never used alone but is a component of both concrete and mortar, as well as stucco, tile grout, and thin-set adhesive. Mortar is composed of cement, fine sands, and lime; it is used as a binding material when building with brick, block, and stone. Concrete is a very strong structural building material

## How to Mix Concrete in a Mixer 
Start by pouring half a bucket of water (aprox. 5l) into the concrete mixer. You will determine the right amount of water with time, because the concrete should have the right consistency. If there is too much water the concrete will be too thin and thus unmanageable. If you use too few water, the concrete, sand and gravel won't mix properly.
