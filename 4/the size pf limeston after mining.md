 Part 1 of a series on adjusting substrate pH will discuss how the type, particle size and hardness of limestone will effect substrate pH. Photo 1. Pulverized or 100 mesh dolomitic limestone is the least reactive in adjusting substrate pH because the particles are larger, similar to sand. All photos: W. Garrett Owen, MSU Extension.
