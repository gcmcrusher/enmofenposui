01.10.2011By contrast where the majority of the uranium occurs in fine grains (that is below 50 μm), such as in a carnotite-bearing calcrete ore, radiometric sorting is not appropriate as the method is unlikely to distinguish the finely disseminated weak radiometric signature in the ore reflective of the fine grained nature of the carnotite with the majority of grains less than 10 μm .

## ROCK CRUSHING METHOD AND SEPARATING GOLD FROM ORES 
13/10/2017Gold ore separation uses comminution techniques to break down the excavated rock, but the material hardly looks like a lustrous yellow-orange metal. In order to properly free this rich element from the rock, the crushing stage has to be followed by a chemically active stage, such as the cyanidation process or the carbon in pulp release method.
