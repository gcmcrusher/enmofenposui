The working principle of ball mill - Meetyou Carbide. The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force.

Conical Ball Mills differ in mill body construction, which is composed of two cones and a short cylindrical part located between them (Fig. 2.12).Such a ball mill body is expedient because efficiency is appreciably increased. Peripheral velocity along the conical drum scales down in the direction from the cylindrical part to the discharge outlet; the helix angle of balls is decreased

The critical speed of ball mill is given by, n c = 1 2 π g R − r. where R = radius of ball mill; r = radius of ball. For R = 1000 mm and r = 50 mm, n c = 30.7 rpm. But the mill is operated at a speed of 15 rpm. Therefore, the mill is operated at 100 x 15/30.7 = 48.86 % of critical speed. If 100 mm dia balls are replaced by 50 mm dia balls
