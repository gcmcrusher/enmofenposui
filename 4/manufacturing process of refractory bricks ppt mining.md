Each site crushed and mixed clay in automated mills ('pans') in segregated areas. Conveyors moved clay to the adjacent brick manufacturing area. In the automated brick manufacturing process, clay was extruded and cut into uncured (green) bricks, which were coated with a parting agent, commonly containing crystalline silica.
