## Experiment #10: Pumps ‚Äì Applied Fluid Mechanics Lab Manual
Experiment #10: Pumps. 1. Introduction. In waterworks and wastewater systems, pumps are commonly installed at the source to raise the water level and at intermediate points to boost the water pressure. The components and design of a pumping station are vital to its effectiveness. Centrifugal pumps are most often used in water and wastewater

18.05.2021The boring machine is one of the most versatile machine tools basically used to bore holes in large and heavy parts practically impossible to hold and rotate in an engine lathe or a drilling machine. For example engine frames, steam engine, cylinders, machine housings, etc. The boring machines come in a large variety of styles and sizes.

A stream of fluid entering in a machine such as a hydraulic or steam turbine, a pump or fan has more or less a defined direction. A force is always required to act upon the fluid to change its velocity either in direction or in magnitude. Newton's Third law of motion states that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

The Operating Principal. P ulverization takes place in the central chamber of the Micron-Master jet energy mill as the process material is driven at near sonic velocity around the perimeter of the toroidal chamber by multiple jets of air or steam. No grinding media is involved. Size reduction is the result of the high-velocity collisions between particles of the process material itself.

1) Positive Displacement Pump. In these types of pumps, the moving parts (gears, lobes, plungers, pistons, and rotors) drain fluid from the pump housing and increase the hydraulic pressure at the same time. Therefore, a positive displacement pump does not build up pressure. It just generates fluid flow.

1.1 Properties of Fluids, Continuum Hypothesis Fluid mechanics is concerned with the behavior of materials which deform without limit under the inÔ¨Çuence of shearing forces. Even a very small shear-ing force will deform a Ô¨Çuid body, but the velocity of the deformation will be correspondingly small.
