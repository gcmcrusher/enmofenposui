Sep 19, 2017Go prefers allocation on the stack — most of the allocations within a given Go program will be on the stack. It's cheap because it only requires two CPU instructions: one to push onto the stack for allocation, and another to release from the stack. Unfortunately not all data can use memory allocated on the stack.

## Performance Tuning in SQL (How to Optimize Performance!)
04.12.2019SQL performance tuning is the process of improving the performance of SQL statements. You want to make sure that SQL statements run as fast as possible. Fast and efficient statements take up fewer hardware resources and perform better. In contrast, an unoptimized inefficient statement will take longer to complete and take up more computing power.

## Optimizing Windows 10, version 1909, for a Virtual Desktop 
Sep 14, 2021The key ways to optimize Windows 10 performance in a VDI environment are to minimize app graphic redraws, background activities that have no major benefit to the VDI environment, and generally reduce running processes to the bare minimum. A secondary goal is to reduce disk space usage in the base image to the bare minimum.
