In most mining districts you can find a combination of hard rock gold and placer gold sources. During the early gold rushes of the 1800s, it was common practice for miners to flock to an area and quickly start prospecting for the easy-to-get placer gold in rivers and creeks. These were the locations where millions of years had concentrated gold into rich pockets and paystreaks, and
