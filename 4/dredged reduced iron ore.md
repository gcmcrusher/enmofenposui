11.07.2018This chapter aims to provide an overview and the evolution of iron ore pelletizing process including: 2. Pelletizing process and raw materials. The iron ore is mined mostly from open pit deposits through mining operations and the raw product, "run of mine," is subjected to mineral processing.

## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview 
In the blast furnace, iron is reduced and melted and the most common product is liquid iron called hot metal. In direct reduction, iron remains in solid state and the product is the so-called direct reduced iron (DRI). Generically, the iron ore products for ironmaking can be classified as shown in Table 1 . Pellets are balls formed by rolling

Direct reduction, is an alternative route of iron making has been developed to overcome some of these difficulties of conventional blast furnaces. DRI is successfully manufactured through either gas or coal-based technology. Iron ore is reduced in solid state at c either by reducing gas (H2+CO) or coal. The direct reduction process

Iron ore is one of the two essential inputs for producing direct reduced iron (DRI); the other being natural gas or another hydrocarbon fuel that can be reformed to create a reducing gas rich in CO and H2.

## Safe carriage of Iron ores other iron concentrates in bulk
In the carriage of iron ore, the following precautions should be taken: Iron ores are heavy cargoes which occupy a small area for a large weight, ie they have a low stowage factor (between 0.240.80 m3/tonne). It is therefore important that the tanktop has sufficient strength to carry certain iron ores. If a bulk carrier loads a homogeneous
