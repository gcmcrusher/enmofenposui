## Chromite 
Chromite is an oxide mineral that an iron chromium oxide with formula: FeCr2O4. It is belonging to the spinel group. Chromite is the most important ore of chromium. Crystals are uncommon, but when found they are octahedral. Chromite is usually massive or in the form of lenses and tabular bodies, or it may be disseminated as granules.
