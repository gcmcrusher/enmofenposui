## Characteristics of open
Abstract. The characteristic differences between open- and closed-circuit grinding systems were examined via the use of a continuous vibration ball mill and a blade type classifier. For the same median diameter of the product, the rate of powder production in the closed-circuit is about 5% higher than that of the open-circuit.
