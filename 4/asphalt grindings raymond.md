## asphalt milling photos
Jan 30, 2019 Asphalt millings are the product of taking old pieces of asphalt and crushing them down into smaller pieces, comparable in size to gravel. This process of breaking down asphalt pieces is commonly done with the help of a milling machine. Milling machines grind up asphalt to a predetermined depth and then vacuum up the milled material.

## Hot Mix Asphalt with High RAP Content 
RAP is a useful alternative to virgin materials because it reduces the use of virgin aggregate and the amount of virgin asphalt binder required in the production of hot mix asphalt (HMA) (Copeland 2011). For higher RAP content (above 25%), design and production takes extra effort, but the savings in using the higher RAP contents significantly

## Asphalt Millings Vs Gravel Driveway 
Come hail or shine, heat or extreme cold, recycled asphalt can take it. If you live in a place where you experience cold winters with loads of snow and ice, an asphalt surface is much better. It produces less formation of ice on the surface and also allows for snow to melt faster than on a gravel driveway or road.
