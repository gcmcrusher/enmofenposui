## Hot Rolling vs Cold Rolling 
Hot rolling results in; refined grain size, removed blow holes, toughness and strength increases. A fiber-like structure is obtained. Cold rolling results in; increased hardness generates cracks, reduced ductility, increased tensile strength and yield strength of steel. Generally hot rolled metal does not shows work hardening effect.

## Metal Rolling 
Rolls used in metal rolling are of various sizes and geometries. In flat rolling processes, during industrial manufacture, the rolls may typically be 24 to 54 inches in diameter. In some metal rolling operations, in the forming of very thin work, the rolls can be as small as 1/4 inch.

24.05.2022In the rolling process, the job is drawn through a set of rolls due to interface friction, and the compressive forces reduce the thickness of the workpiece or change its cross-sectional area.. The types of rolls used in rolling mills are depended upon the shape, size, and the gap between the rolls and their contour. Because of workability and limitations in equipment,

## Rolling Mills 
In rolling mills, intermediate steel products are given their final shape and dimension in a series of shaping and finishing operations. Most of the slabs are heated in reheating furnaces and rolled into final shape in hot– or cold–rolling or finishing mills. While some products (e.g. reinforcement bars, steel plates) only require hot-rolling, some others may require both hot– and cold
