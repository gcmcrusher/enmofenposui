1. Divide the depth of clay by the total depth of all the soil and the organic matter. 2. Multiply the answer by 100 to obtain the percentage of clay. eg. if there's a total of 10cm of soil and organic matter, of which 2cm is clay, divide 2 by 10 (=0.2), then multiply by 100 (=20) to obtain the percentage (20%).

## Digital Sustainability 
There's a lot of scope there to reduce waste material production and energy consumption. For example, foundries using the green sand process for moulding consume sand, clay and other chemicals and cores. Producing scrap, then remelting and recasting means more of these materials and the associated energy are consumed too.
