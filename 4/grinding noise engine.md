14.09.201237. I'd appreciate some opinions on what may be causing a new noise from the engine bay. I have a 1GM10 attached to the shaft by a flexible coupling and this weekend, motor sailing back from the Dart Regatta, there began a worrying and loud metalic grating noise from the engine bay. It was intermitent and seemed to be triggered by higher revs.

19.05.2020An old trick for locating squealing belts and pulleys is to spritz them with water. When spritzed the squealing will disappear for a few seconds. You could spritz the electro-magnetic PTO clutch surfaces with water. If the squealing goes away you found your problem. The water will dry quickly once the clutch is engaged and not hurt anything.

What I don't like is the grinding noise when decelerating (engine braking) with the engine dropping to around 2,000 - 2,500 rpm. I know that this noise is normal for the 5-speed transmission, and the only known solution to this is to replace the flywheel with a heavier one, which is something I don't want to do.
