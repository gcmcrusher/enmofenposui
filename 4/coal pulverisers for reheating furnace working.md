## Towards CO2
Additionally, the possible development until 2050 is analysed. The results show the high impact of continuous reheating furnaces in steel hot rolling mills on the total CO2-emissions of downstream steel processing. Furthermore, the massive increase in electrical energy consumption of the whole steel production process is highlighted.
