## The reasons for dust generation of jaw crusher
Jul 29, 2022When the crusher works, it produces dust with a large amount and a high density. The suction hood is far away from the dust outlet and its angle is inappropriate, which makes dust easy to diffuse and difficult to collect. The pressure of spraying water is low and the nebulization effect is terrible. Less spraying devices are set there. There is
