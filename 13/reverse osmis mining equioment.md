## Reverse osmosis 
Reverse osmosis (RO) is a water purification process that uses a partially permeable membrane to separate ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles from drinking water. In reverse osmosis, an applied pressure is used to overcome osmotic pressure, a colligative property that is driven by chemical potential differences of the solvent, a thermodynamic parameter.

## Everything You Need To Know About Reverse Osmosis 
11.11.2021Reverse osmosis takes advantage of such pressure to force the water through a semipermeable membrane. When the water passes through the semipermeable membrane, all the impurities and toxic elements are left behind in the membrane. The process ensures you obtain clean, safe drinking water, even from the tap! However, contaminated water has to go
