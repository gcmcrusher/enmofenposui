Ball Mill Operation. Ball mills ride on steel tires or supported on both ends by trunnions. Girth gears bolted to the shell drive the mill through a pinion shaft from a prime mover drive. The prime movers are usually synchronized motors. During rotation, a portion of the charge is lifted along the inside perimeter.

## Laboratory Mills 
Ball mills are characterized by their smaller (comparatively) diameter and longer length, and often have a length 1.5 to 2.5 times the diameter. The feed is at one end of the cylinder and the discharge is at the other. Small versions of ball mills can be found in laboratories where they are used for grinding sample material for quality assurance.
