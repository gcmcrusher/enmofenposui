## Designing Better Conveyors for Bulk Material Handling
A belt conveyor, on average, uses about 20% of the space within the housing for material movement. This number can be as high as 50% on average for something like a drag chain conveyor. The benefit is that you can move more material at slower speeds, in a small housing enclosure, with less horsepower – which ultimately means lower energy
