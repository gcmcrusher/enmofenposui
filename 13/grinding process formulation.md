## Pigment Grind: How to Efficiently Adjust the Fineness 
In the industry, the fineness of grind is generally achieved with a 2-step process. First, developers and producers of paints use a dissolver to reduce the particle size of their pigments and fillers to a certain degree of fineness. Then, when needed, they additionally use a pearl mill to further separate the solid particles from each other.
