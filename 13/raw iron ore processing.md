28.10.2021Lower Energy Consumption. Mining is costly and requires large amounts of energy. It requires various machines for mining and refining raw materials, while recycling has considerably fewer energy costs. Energy is roughly 30% of primary aluminum production costs, while aluminum scrap uses 5% of the energy during production.

## Metallurgic Processes 
Steelmaking is the second step in producing steel from iron ore, where impurities are removed from the raw iron, and alloying elements are added to produce the exact steel required. Modern steelmaking processes are broken into two categories: primary and secondary steelmaking. Primary steelmaking uses mostly new iron as the feedstock, usually from a blast furnace.
