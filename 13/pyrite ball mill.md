## Ultrafine Grinding Of Pyrite 
Jun 01, 2007 As the cracks and defects of pyrite reduce when the particles decrease to micron dimension, it is difficult for pyrite to comminute on wet ultra-fine grinding. Ultrafine grinding uses a different milling action relative to a conventional ball mill. Fine ceramic media (~3 mm) is agitated through stirring,

Chalcopyrite or pyrite mineral of 100 g was dry-ground in a laboratory ball mill and the formation of hydrogen peroxide was studied when the dry-ground solids are mixed in water. The effect of water pH in which the solids are mixed, on the formation of hydrogen peroxide is shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b (Javadi et al., 2013).
