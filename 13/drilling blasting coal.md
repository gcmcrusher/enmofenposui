Through seam blasting' uses blast holes that extend through the coal seam down to a nominated drill depth. The technique allows for simultaneous fragmentation of the overburden and inter-burden material which minimises disturbance to the coal seams. It requires inert stemming material to be placed in sequence with the explosive in each hole.

## Blasting Safety 
The bounds of the blast area were not adequately determined for this blast. In a coal mine blast, flyrock traveled 900 feet and landed beyond the permit boundary causing a fatal injury [MSHA, 1990a]. During a construction blasting operation near Marlboro, NY, flyrock was showered on passing motorists on Route 9 W about 180 feet from the blast pit.

01.11.20181. Introduction. Mining activity is mostly represented by these four main operations: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. For a proper mine planning and design, all of these operations need to be carefully planned in such a manner that can prevent extra loads such as operating costs, environmental footprints, etc. Amongst these operations, drilling and

The geotechnical assessment required that a bench should be blasted in at 15m and the final face left at an angle of 15 (the existing face was undercutting in places and at 25 in others). The top of the tunnel was at a depth of 9m and the bottom at 11m, so a detailed pre-drill survey was required. Approximately 30,000 tonnes of rock was to
