## Ball Mill 
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

## Characteristics and uses of forged steel balls in iron ore mines
01.07.2019The iron ore forged steel ball has a smooth surface and uniform hardness to ensure that it does not lose its roundness during the grinding process. It is produced by forging hot-rolling forging and forming, with no defects on the surface, no deformation, no loss of roundness, and wear resistance. It is relatively high.
