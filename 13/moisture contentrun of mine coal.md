## Evaluation of some optimum moisture and binder conditions for coal 
Mechanization has made coal mining more efficient, but fines generation has subsequently increased. Up to 6% of the run of mine material can report to the -200 μm fraction. Common problems associated with fines handling include dust formation, storage problems, and high moisture levels. A method to turn this material into a saleable product instead of stockpiling it

01.10.2020Fig. 6 shows the percentage of the two types of water in coals. The percentage of bound water content, ranging from 68.39% to 92.11%, with an average of 82.6%, is higher than that of moveable water content. The percentage of movable water content varies from 7.89% to 31.61%, with an average of 17.4%.

Coal consumption is on an increase in overall terms, albeit falling as a share of total energy consumption. World coal consumption climbed from 2.58 billion tons of standard coal in 1980, to 5.47 billion tons of standard coal in 2013, representing annual growth of about 2.3% and basically in proportion to the growth in the world's total energy consumption.

wetting and moisture evaporation depending on the environmental circumstances of the coal [8-10]. Numerical model studies by Akgun and Essenhigh [11] showed that moisture effects on self-heating in a broken coal stockpile situation are twofold. In the case of low moisture content coals, the maximum temperature increases steadily with time.
