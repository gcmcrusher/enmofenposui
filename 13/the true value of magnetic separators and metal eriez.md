13.07.2018Resistivity, also referred to as specific resistance, is dependent on the nature of the material as well as its volume definition (shape and size). Resistivity is expressed in units that are the product of resistance and length; e.g., Ωcm. The symbol most commonly used for resistivity is rho ( ρ ). Conductivity is the reciprocal of resistivity.

Magnetic Poles. 1. A freely suspended bar magnet will always tend to align itself with the North and South magnetic poles of the earth. An example of this is the magnetic compass. This shows the magnetic lines of force for a long, narrow bar magnet. North is on the right end. This shows the magnetic lines of force for a flat, wide magnet.
