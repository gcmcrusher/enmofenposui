## bauxite from new guinea
Dec 17, 2019 Guinea is the world's third-largest producer of bauxite behind Australia and China, having overtaken Brazil in 2017. Most production is of metallurgical grades but there has been renewed interest in Guinea as a supplier of non-metallurgical bauxite in recent years. SMB-Winning has mined bauxite in Guinea since 2014.
