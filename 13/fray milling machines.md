Apr 06, 2014Messages. 4. Apr 4, 2014. #5. Nice find! The Fray machines make for excellent hobby mills, especially with the all angle head. From what I understand, a rather common problem with them is for the back gears to be stripped out of the head. Hopefully yours are in good shape!

## DRO for milling machine 
03.01.2013A knee mill actually has 4 axis of movement. X, Y, and two Zs. The knee and the quill together make up the Z. Many people choose to use the DRO on just the knee, or just the quill. Some of the good DROs will add up the knee and quill to provide a single number.

Sep 10, 2009It is the Kempsmith No. 1 Plain type horizontal miller. The advertisement is from the same July 1915 edition of Canadian Machinery as the one I posted on the Briggs Mill.
