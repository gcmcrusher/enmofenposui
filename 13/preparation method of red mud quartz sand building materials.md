Mud mortar shall be stabilised 1.5 times more than the mud blocks. Add course sand (0.2 to 2mm) to reduce shrinkage. Prepare plastic mix rather than dry mix. Ideal mix = soil suitable for mud block + 40% to 50% of sand by weight + 7.5% cement. Test the mortar before use. Procedure Start with a mix of 1 vol. Cement + 6 vol. Soil + 6 vol. Sand.

## Stabilizing a Muddy Road 
09/03/2019Stabilizing a Muddy Road. The most common approach to firming up a muddy road is to add gravel. Although this can occasionally be effective, there is a saying in the trade that "adding a bucket of gravel to a bucket of mud just gets you a bigger bucket of mud.". There is much truth to this quip, as adding something to a muddy road often has

19.04.2016Step One – Excavation. You can't just dump a few wheelbarrows of gravel on the ground and call it a day. When we do a gravel path for a client project we dig down 4-6 inches. That lets us eliminate the sod and/or plant matter in the top few inches, and it allows us to create a cleanly defined shape for the path.
