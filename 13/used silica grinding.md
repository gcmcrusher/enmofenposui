## Silica 
Silica, also known as Silicon dioxide, is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula SiO 2, most commonly found in nature as quartz and in various living organisms. In many parts of the world, silica is the major constituent of sand. Silica is one of the most complex and most abundant families of materials, existing as a compound of several minerals and as synthetic

## Why is Silica Hazardous? 
Silica, often referred to as quartz, is a very common mineral. It is found in many materials common on construction and oil gas sites, including soil, sand, concrete, masonry, rock, granite, and landscaping materials. The dust created by cutting, grinding, drilling or otherwise disturbing these materials can contain crystalline silica

## Silica 
Silica dust can cause silicosis, a serious and irreversible lung disease. It can also cause lung cancer. Cutting, breaking, crushing, drilling, grinding, or blasting concrete or stone releases the dust. As workers breathe in the dust the silica settles in their lungs.
