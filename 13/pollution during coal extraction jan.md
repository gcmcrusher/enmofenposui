15.01.2016This difference is attributed to greater emissions during bitumen extraction. However, significant technological advancements are helping to improve operating efficiencies and reduce this gap. Currently, the carbon footprint of fuels produced from oil sands is on par or better than heavy oil production from Venezuela, Mexico and California. The carbon footprint

11.06.2019There are several ways in which natural gas contributes to air pollution. For example, fugitive gas that escapes via leakage or venting causes significant pollution during the production phase. Venting is intentional, through pneumatic valves or vents on storage tanks, refinery equipment and wells following hydraulic fracturing, or from oil wells.

## The Steam Engine, the Industrial Revolution and Coal
During the Middle Ages, coal fueled the ovens of blacksmiths and artisans. As the growing population consumed more and more of England's forests, coal burning became widespread enough to inspire laws against its use due to the smoke and pollution burning it produced. Nonetheless the market for coal continued to grow as . it preserved the limited timber growth.
