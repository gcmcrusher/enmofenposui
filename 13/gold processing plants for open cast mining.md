## Extracting Gold In Opencast Mines 
Reading: Open-Pit Mining Geology Gold is generally extracted in open-pit mines at 1 to 2 ppm parts per million but in certain cases 0.75 ppm gold is economical. This was achieved by bulk heap leaching at the Peak Hill mine in western New South Wales near Dubbo Australia. Nickel generally as laterite is extracted via open-pit down to 0.2%.
