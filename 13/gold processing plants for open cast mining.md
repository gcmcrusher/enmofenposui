## Extracting Gold In Opencast Mines 
Reading: Open-Pit Mining Geology Gold is generally extracted in open-pit mines at 1 to 2 ppm parts per million but in certain cases 0.75 ppm gold is economical. This was achieved by bulk heap leaching at the Peak Hill mine in western New South Wales near Dubbo Australia. Nickel generally as laterite is extracted via open-pit down to 0.2%.

## Open Pit Mining Techniques
Open Pit Mining. Open-pit mining, also known as opencast mining, open-cut mining, and strip mining, means a process of digging out rock or minerals from the earth by their elimination from an open pit or borrow. The word is used to distinguish this type of mining from extractive methods that need tunneling into the earth.
