The process of enriching taconite ore involved grinding the ore to remove gangues and upgrading the iron ore (i.e., an ore beneficiation process). The resultant high grade ore is in the form of fine particles, as small as 0.1 mm or less, which are not suitable for sintering.

Chemical analyses performed by the IIT Research Institute in 1970 found that tailings from taconite ore beneficiation were composed of a variety of constituents, such as metal oxides. A summary of the constituents found in taconite tailings, along with their associated concentrations, is listed in Table 1-8 (Aleshin 1978; Schwartz 1970).
