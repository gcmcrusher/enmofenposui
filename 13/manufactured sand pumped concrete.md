## Pumped Screed 
Our cementitious screed floor systems can be applied at a minimum thickness of 10mm and then diamond polished. This gives a natural polished concrete effect without exposing large aggregate that's generally seen with polished concrete. Pumped screed self-levelling compound can be laid at a minimal thickness of 7mm.

## Ready Mix Concrete (RMC) – Setting up to Manufacturing Concrete
Ready-mix concrete (RMC) is usually manufactured in a batch plant or concrete plant. It is a mixture consisting of Portland cement, water, and aggregates as mentioned in the manufacture of concrete such as sand, gravel, and crushed stone. This concrete is particularly manufactured in a place for construction of buildings, bridges and even

Naturally, the concrete mix must be suitable for its particular application, but it must also contain enough water for the mix to move easily through the reducers, bends and hoses found in most basic pipeline setups.
