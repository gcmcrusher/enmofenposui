## Hammer Mills 
Hammer mills utilize a central rotating shaft, affixed with several "hammers" on pivots attached to the shaft. As the shaft spins, the hammers are swung via rotational energy, causing them to collide with the material, breaking it up into smaller particles. The unit efficiently converts oversize agglomerates into the desired product range of minus 4 mesh to plus 20 mesh. FEECO is
