## Belt Conveyor Systems 
Belt Conveyor Systems. A belt conveyor system transports materials from one point to another. The system comprises two or more pulleys and a closed conveyor belt on a tight sleeve. A drive pulley causes the belt to rotate. A second pulley referred to as the idler or reversing pulley helps in changing the belt's direction of movement.
