## Iron in plants and soil 
Iron is the fourth most abundant element found in soil though it is largely present in forms that cannot be taken up by plants. Iron, in small amounts, is essential for healthy plant growth and is classed as a micronutrient. It is important for the development and function of chlorophyll and a range of enzymes and proteins.

Iron Ore Process Plants. The wet scrubbing units are used to break down the sticky clays attached to the ore, into a fine suspended clay fraction suitable for subsequent wet beneficiation.Beneficiation is the process of separating the valuable material from the waste material.After passing through the wet scrubber units the ore is fed into the screening circuit.

## How iron is made 
Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes. The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 92-94% iron and 3-5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.

## DRI production 
DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state, i.e. without melting, as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen, coming from reformed natural gas, syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.
