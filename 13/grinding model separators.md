This is for a small installation in a restaurant with a seating capacity up to 100 people. For larger grinders with higher h.p. ratings, each additional 1/2 h.p. requires an increase of 20 gallons to the separator. Thus, a 1 h.p. grinder requires a 70 gallon holding capacity, a 1 1/2 h.p. grinder requires a 90 gallon holding capacity, and so on.
