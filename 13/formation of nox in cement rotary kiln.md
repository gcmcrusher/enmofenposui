## Reducing NOx from existing cement kiln lines
In cement kiln lines, significant amounts of NOx emissions can be formed both in the rotary kiln and in the precalciner. To reduce NOx formation, low NOx techniques can be applied to the burner and to the combustion systems used in the rotary kilns and precalciners, respectively. These low NOx techniques have the dual advantage of (i) low CAPEX cost and (ii) no

## Current state of NOx abatement in the cement industry
Oxides of nitrogen are produced in rotary kiln plants in the cement industry because of the nature of the process. In Germany the cement works are governed by the NOx limits set by TA Luft (German Clean Air Standards), which have been updated progressively during the past years. This specifies NOx emissions of 0.50 g/m3 for new plants and 0.80 g/m3 for existing

The main objective of a kiln feed system is to feed the kiln at any desired rate set by operator (from CCR) and to maintain it with a close degree accuracy ( 2 %) throughout the feed rate range.

## METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REDUCING THE NOX EMISSIONS IN A ROTARY KILN 
1. A method for reducing the NOx emissions of a rotary kiln of a clinker production plant, in which fuel supplied through a burner of the rotary kiln is burned along with primary air fed through the burner and the primary air has an oxygen content reduced relative to that of the ambient air and a temperature increased relative to that of the ambient air, the primary air being obtained by

quality. The kiln system – the rotary kiln and preheater tower calciner (if installed) – is the most important source of NO x emissions at a cement plant. Because of the success of modern kilns with preheater towers equipped with calciners, this article will focus mainly on this configuration. The clinkerisation of raw materials
