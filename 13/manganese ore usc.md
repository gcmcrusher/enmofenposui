Manganese fines. With their high manganese content, our fines have been developed for the production of silicomanganese (SiMn). This ore is used to improve process performance (less waste, reduced energy consumption), particularly in the production of agglomerates. Its low iron content makes it highly complementary to iron rich ores.

Manganese ore is required in iron making to control the manganese content of the hot metal in the desired range. The most important manganese ores are the oxides pyrolusite, romanechite, manganite, hausmannite and the carbonate ore rhodochrosite. Rhodonite and braunite, both silicate ores, are frequently found with the oxides.
