## History of electrolysis hair removal 
Dangerous Alternatives. Because of the high cost and long duration of electrolysis, practitioners were always on the lookout for an alternative. In 1885 Leopold Freund, pioneer of radiotherapy, applied x-rays to a patient with a large hairy growth covering most of her back. After 20 hours of x-ray exposure the hair fell out.

Electrolysis is commercially important as a stage in the separation of elements from naturally occurring sources such as ores using an electrolytic cell.The voltage that is needed for electrolysis to occur is called the

## Electrolysis 
Electrolysis is a chemical reaction that uses an electric current to break the bonds that hold molecules together. An enelctrolyzer is a machine that can introduce an electric current into a liquid using two pieces of metal called electrodes.The electric current can cause ions to move within compounds, which allows the reaction of electrolysis to take place.

Electrolysis is carried out on electrolytes which are ionic → 2Na (l) + Cl 2 (g) Down's Process: Sodium chloride melts at a very high temperature of 801C. Addition of anhydride calcium chloride in the ratio of CaCl 2: NaCl = 3:2 reduces the melting point to 580C. Electrolysis is done with an iron cathode and graphite anode
