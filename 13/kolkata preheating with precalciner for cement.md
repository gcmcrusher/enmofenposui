However, most cement plants run with a higher calcination rate than necessary. Reducing the amount of calcination in the precalciner will reduce the gas temperature into the preheater and reduce fuel consumption. The preheater recuperates a fixed percentage of the heat in the combustion exhaust gases from the kiln and precalciner.
