## Beneficiation operations 
Beneficiation operations are physical or mechanical unit operations where valuable mineral particles are separated from the mixture of liberated valuable mineral particles and gangue mineral particles. Every beneficiation operation is based on one or more physical properties in which valuable and gangue minerals differ in that property.

## Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation) 
Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation) The first process most ores undergo after they leave the mine is mineral dressing (processing), also called ore preparation, milling, and ore dressing or ore beneficiation. Ore dressing is a process of mechanically separating the grains of ore minerals from the gangue minerals, to produce a concentrate

It is the most important process for soil formation. Chemical weathering takes place mainly at the surface of rocks and minerals with disappearance of certain minerals and the formation of secondary products (new materials). This is called chemical transformation. Feldspar + water clay mineral + soluble cations and anions.
