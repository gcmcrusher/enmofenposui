SAG mills of comparable size but containing say 10% ball charge (in addition to the rocks), normally, operate between 70 and 75% of the critical speed. Dry Aerofall mills are run at about 85% of the

Calculation For Speed Of Ball Mill Of 21 Rpm Ball Mill. Calculations: the critical speed of ball mill is given by, where r = radius of ball mill; r = radius of ball. for r = 1000 mm and r = 50 mm, n c = 30.7 rpm. but the mill is operated at a speed of 15 rpm. therefore, the mill is operated at 100 x 15/30.7 = 48.86 % of critical speed..
