16.07.2014During roasting, refractory gold ore is treated with extremely hot air. This causes the sulfites to oxidize, separate from the ore, and become sulfur dioxide. Once all of the sulfides are oxidized, the remaining gold ore can be processed normally. The roasting method has been around for hundreds of years. Prior to the 20th century, the process

Many gold ores and concentrates contain fine grained gold locked within sulphide minerals, such as pyrite and/or arsenopyrite, unavailable for recovery by conventional leaching. In Sherritt's gold process, the sulphide and arsenide minerals are completely oxidized by pressure oxidation, thereby liberating the gold. Subsequent treatment by
