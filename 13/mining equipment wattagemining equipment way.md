## RTX 3060 hashrates for Ravencoin, Conflux, Ethereum, Firo
The way I approached overclocking: maximum hashrate first, reasonably low wattage second. Hashrates and wattages can probably be perfected further, especially by those who are more experienced in overclocking for a specific coin. It seems that the wattage sweet spot is at W. Less than that, and hashrate starts to drop.

The maximum VRAM temperature while mining is 110C, which should be avoided by following this guide. Running the GPU at higher than 95C will start to thermal throttle the GPU. Thermal throttling is when the GPU slows down itself to prevent overheating. This will cause slower mining speed and less potential earnings.
