Concrete's strength changes depending on the ballast used; lightweight ballast results in weaker concrete. The strength of the concrete produced fluctuates when the quantity and uniformity of ballast are changed. Concrete's imperial strength is expressed in pounds per square inch (psi) or megapascals (MPa).

So for the concrete mix mentioned above, your cement: sand: aggregate ratio should be 1:2:4 or ballast to cement ratio of 6 to 1. For a low-grade concrete with 10MPa strength, the perfect ratio should be 1:3:6. For 30MPa concrete use 1:0.75:1.5.
