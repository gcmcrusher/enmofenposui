## Molecular design and application of luminescent materials composed 
Mechanical stimuli, such as pressing, crushing and grinding, occasionally change the luminescent color of crystalline samples of solid-state emissive molecules. This property is called mechano- or piezochromic luminescence and is expected to be utilized for pressure sensors and optical recording/memory devices [ 35–43 ].
