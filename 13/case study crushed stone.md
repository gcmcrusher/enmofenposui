Canada that produces crushed stone for concrete and construction contacted their local Goulds Pumps distributor. The original pump installed in their process was a rubber lined slurry pump. Unfortunately this pump was failing after only 200 to 250 hours of operation, resulting in significant downtime, maintenance, and replacement parts costs.

## Crushed Stone 
Crushed stone is a versatile product that can be used in a wide range of applications from construction to road building and even agriculture. The most common types of crushed stone include limestone, granite, trap rock and dolomite. In smaller amounts, slate, sandstone, marble and volcanic cinder can also be used for construction aggregates.

## Standard Gravel Decomposed Granite for Pathways Trails
09.06.2022Both naturally occurring decomposed granite and crushed stone screenings are completely organic and environmentally safe. Kafka Granite's Standard Pathway Mix aggregate is 1/4″ minus with fines. This specific size allows the product to compact well, creating a firmer surface than conventional gravel, while still allowing water to permeate through.
