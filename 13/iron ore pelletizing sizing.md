## Pelletizing plant 
13.07.2021Pelletizing is the process of converting very fine iron ores into spheres (normally 8mm-20mm in diameter), known as pellets. These pellets are suitable for both blast furnaces and direct iron reduction processes.. Pelletizing normally has four processes: (i) receipt of raw materials, (ii) pretreatment, (iii) balling and (iv) induration and cooling.

## Pellet (Iron ore) 
Iron ore pellets vary in size from 8 to 18 mm and are the principal raw material for blast furnaces. 67-72% of these pellets are composed of iron, and the rest is made up of binders (clay) and limestone, dolostone, and olivine. The reason why iron ore is preferred in the form of pellets, rather than as particles, is that pellets allow better airflow in the furnace, thereby ensuring

1. Iron ore - supply and demand outline 1.1 Types of iron ore Iron ores can be classified in different ways. The most important has to do with the iron content. In many cases, ore with a total iron content of 60% to 63%, or greater, is regarded as high grade, and ore with a lower iron content is regarded as low grade.

## Investigation on Loss on Ignition to Study the Effect of Iron Ore 
24/10/2021Apart from the natural and mechanical forces, the iron ore feed size distribution, disc operating parameters, process parameters, feed characteristics, and ore mineralogy have significant impact on the formation of green pellets. The degree of inclination of the pelletizing disc was varied from 42 to 57. The disc rpm was varied from 12 to 20.

## Iron Ore Pellets and Pelletizing Processes 
Iron ore pellets and Pelletizing processes. Pelletizing is a process that involves mixing very finely ground particles of iron ore fines of size less than 200 mesh with additives like bentonite and then shaping them into oval/spherical lumps of 8-16 mm in diameter by a pelletizer and hardening the balls by firing with a fuel. It is the process of converting iron ore fines into

## The iron ore importance in Direct Reduction 
The most suitable particle size of iron ores to be processed in the HYL reactor is in the range of +6 mm and -16 mm. a) Large particles present higher resistance for reduction. b) Small particles tend to increase the pressure-drop (∆P). Reducibility The reducibility of the iron ores depends mainly on: a) Particle ore porosity. b) Particle size.
