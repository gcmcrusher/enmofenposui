## Gold Refining Process 
Our gold refining process begins when we receive your scrap gold (or other precious metals) to be recycled. To determine the metal's purity, we perform an assay. Once we have assayed the weight and purity of the gold, we have all the information we need to quote you a payout price. From there, your gold is melted down in our refinery.

For refining, gold bearing alloys are processed on different methods, depending on their carat content. Two methods are commonly employed for purification: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process. Alternatively, it can be a complex mix of burning, drying, grinding, screening, blending and sampling for low-grade scrap and floor sweepings.
