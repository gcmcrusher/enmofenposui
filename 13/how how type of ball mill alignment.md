## Hammer Mills 
Our hammer mills reduce dry and semi-moist materials with a minimum amount of fines and caking or plastering within the crusher. They are ideal for granulated and pelletized materials. Hammer mills utilize a central rotating shaft, affixed with several "hammers" on pivots attached to the shaft. As the shaft spins, the hammers are swung via
