The crusher "breaks it and the fine material produced will drop through the gap between the mantle and the liner as it opens. The coarse material that can't fall through will remain to be crushed with the next gyration.

## The Aggregate Mining Process 
The Aggregate Mining Process. Aggregate mining in New York takes two forms. The simplest process involves sand and gravel excavation. Sand and gravel are unconsolidated minerals that can be mined using a front-end loader or excavator then processed through crushers and screens to make the desired end product. Excavator removing sand and gravel.

## Crusher 
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
