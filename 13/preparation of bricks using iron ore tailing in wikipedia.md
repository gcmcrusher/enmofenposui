## Iron Ore Statistics and Information 
Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.

## Clay 
Clay was used as a mortar in brick chimneys and stone walls where protected from water. The forecasted mass of clay minerals to be discharged into the tailings of ore processing makes up millions of tons. Worryingly, when macro- and micro-components are found in non-hazardous concentrations, fewer efforts are put into the environmental management of the tailings,

The Ridgeway mine was a gold and silver open-pit mine near Ridgeway, South Carolina.In its eleven years of operation between 1988 and 1999 it produced 1,500,000 ounces of gold and 900,000 ounces of silver. The mine's two ore bodies are part of the gold-rich Carolina Slate Belt rock package that runs through the upstate Piedmont foothills.

## Fabrication of Baking
Background: Tailings produced from iron ore smelting processes have increased dramatically in recent decades. The storage of tailings not only needs high cost, but also causes a great environmental and safety hazard. Therefore, it is urgent to use new technologies to comprehensively utilize tailings.

Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef, or placer deposit.Exploitation of these deposits for raw material is based on the economic viability of investing in the equipment, labor, and energy required to extract, refine and transport the materials found at the mine to manufacturers who

## Steel making process – ArcelorMittal
Steel is produced from iron ore or scrap. Iron ore is a mineral aggregate that can be converted economically into iron. The quality of the iron ore is mainly determined by its composition; a high iron content and low sulphur and phosphorus contents are favorable. Iron ore can be found all over the world, but its iron content varies. Steel scrap

Bricks are a decorative building block. Bricks naturally generate in underwater ruins, and in plains village armorer houses. Bricks can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Bricks have the same blast resistance as other stone-based blocks, so they can be used as a durable building block. Bricks can be placed under note blocks to
