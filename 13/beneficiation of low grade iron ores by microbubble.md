## Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging
25/09/2018There are several issues relating to categorization and beneficiation of low grade iron ores. The main difficulty in processing and utilization of low grade iron ores is primarily due to their mineralogical characteristics, the soft nature of some of the ores, and their high silica content or alumina content or both.
