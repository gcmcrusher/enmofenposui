## How we process and recover gold 
Gravity recoverable gold (or free gold) is processed using centrifugal concentrators, which significantly shortens the processing time for gold recovered. About 15% of South Deep's gold is recovered using the gravity concentrator circuit. Step 3: Thickening and Leaching.

The Recovery of Fine Gold With the rising price of gold and the limited amount of mineable land, people are now focusing on the recovery of fine gold – this requires enhanced gravity concentrators. Some rivers of the word have been sluiced as many as 6 times yielding profitable gold each time – and demonstrating that traditional sluices can have very poor mineral recovery.

A Knelson or Falcon concentrator is designed to process fine, free gold that does not require cyanidation for recovery. These use the principle of centrifugal force which aids in the separation process based on the particle density. In the laboratory, these generally are operated as batch processes but can be made to operate continuously.

Gold Centrifugal Concentrator Mineral Processing. The centrifugal concentrator rotates at a high speed, generating a high "G" force, which can separate small gravity recovery gold (less than 50 microns), which was of previously unrecoverable with traditional mineral jigs, spiral separator, and gravity tables.

## gold centrifugal concentrator 
Gold centrifugal concentrator is useful in the gold recovery in all ranges of particle size. It is most especially useful for recovering fine gold which gets lost during the operation of gravity concentrators. The application has shown that the recovery of gold can be very high, as much as 99% and the concentration ratio is up to 1,000 times.
