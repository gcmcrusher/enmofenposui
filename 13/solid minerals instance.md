## 4 Things That Define Minerals 
25.03.2019Ice is a mineral, even though it isn't listed in the mineral field guide. When ice collects in large enough bodies, it flows in its solid state -- that's what glaciers are. And salt behaves similarly, rising underground in broad domes and sometimes spilling out in salt glaciers.Indeed, all minerals, and the rocks they are part of, slowly deform given enough heat

## Mineral 
Mineral. Minerals are bodies of inorganic nature that occur in a solid state. The earth is made up mainly of rocks. From the minerals and rocks of the earth's surface we obtain a large part of the resources we need to live. In addition to that, minerals are inorganic substances that are present in some essential foods in the human body.
