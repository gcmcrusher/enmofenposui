In 2021, we expect recovering economic activity to reverse 2020's decline in coal demand, with a 4.5% increase pushing global coal demand above 2019 levels. The power sector accounted for just over 40% of the drop in coal use in 2020, but the rapid increase in coal-fired generation in Asia sees it account for three-quarters of the rebound in

India has about 90,000 MW installed capacity for electricity generation, of which more than 70% is produced by coal-based thermal power plants. Hydro-electricity contributes about 25%, and the remaining is mostly from nuclear power plants (NPPs). The problems associated with the use of coal are low calorific value and very high ash content.

The calorific value of a fuel is the quantity of heat produced by its combustion – at constant pressure and under "normal" (standard) conditions (i.e. to 0 o C and under a pressure of 1,013 mbar). The combustion process generates water vapor and certain techniques may be used to recover the quantity of heat contained in this water vapor by condensing it.

## supercritical coal plant coal calorific values
 Supercritical coal plants are a type of coal-fired power plant used in more modern designs. They differ from traditional coal power plants because the water running through it works as a supercritical fluid, meaning it is neither a liquid or a gas.This occurs when water reaches its critical point under high pressures and temperatures, specifically at 22 MPa and

## The Influence of Coal Calorific Value on Power Plant Boiler 
The calorific value of coal is an important factor which affects the stability of combustion and the economy of boiler operation. If the boiler is used in the power plant boiler, the boiler heat efficiency and the net efficiency of the power plant will be reduced, and the combustion efficiency will be reduced. It is very important to improve the economy of the power plant by using the
