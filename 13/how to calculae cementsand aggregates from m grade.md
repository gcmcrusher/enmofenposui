## How to Calculate the Quantity of Cement, Sand Aggregate 
20.10.2020Solution: In case of M 20 concrete, the ratio of cement, sand and aggregate is 1 : 1.5 : 3. Dry volume of concrete = wet volume of concrete 1.54 [ You can take this factor 1.54 to 1.57 ] Hence, the dry volume of concrete is = 2 1.54 = 3.08 m 3. The required quantity of cement is = (Cement ratio Sum of all ratio) Total volume of
