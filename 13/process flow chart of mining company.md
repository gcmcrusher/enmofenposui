## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively,

## Salt Production and Processing 
Most mine shafts are lined with a concrete wall called a shaft liner. Salt is mined by the room and pillar method. It is removed in a checkerboard pattern to leave permanent, solid salt pillars for mine roof support. Usually 45 to 65 percent of the salt is removed. The room height may average 18 feet in a bedded deposit to 100 feet in a dome mine.

## Lithium Mining 
Lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, and batteries. It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl (Si2O 5) 2, lepidolite K (Li,Al) 3 (Al,Si,Rb) 4 O 10 (F,OH) 2, spodumene LiAl (SiO 3) 2 and also subsurface brines. Australia and Chile are the world's largest producers of lithium.
