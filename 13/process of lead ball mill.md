In the ball mill, Lead is converted to Lead Oxide, by grinding and oxidation process, which is an exothermic process. In this process, heat is generated and temperature of oxide is increased, to control the temperature with in the operating range of 115 to 135C, the ball mill temperature is controlled with constant flow of air and with the water spraying system controlled through

Conical Ball Mills differ in mill body construction, which is composed of two cones and a short cylindrical part located between them (Fig. 2.12).Such a ball mill body is expedient because efficiency is appreciably increased. Peripheral velocity along the conical drum scales down in the direction from the cylindrical part to the discharge outlet; the helix angle of balls is decreased

Lead is a dense, soft, low-melting metal. It is an important component of batteries, and about 75% of the world's lead production is consumed by the battery industry. Lead is the densest common metal except for gold, and this quality makes it effective in sound barriers and as a shield against X-rays. Lead resists corrosion by water, so it has
