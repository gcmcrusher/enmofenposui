## Grinding 
Grinding is a significant and critical part of the ore winning process. On average, milling is the process that requires the most energy in the whole mining operation. To ensure profitable operations, an efficient grinding circuit has to be designed, especially now, where global mineral resources are decreasing and the exploitation of low-grade deposits become necessary.
