21.08.2007The strongly peraluminous, P- and F-rich granitic system at Podles in the Krušn Hory Mountains, Czech Republic, resembles the zonation of rare element pegmatites in its magmatic evolution (biotite → protolithionite → zinnwaldite granites). All granite types contain disseminated Nb-Ta-Ti-W-Sn minerals that crystallized in the following succession: rutile +
