## Lime and Limestone in Glass Manufacturing 
A commercially important property of lime is its ability to form solutions with silicates. When lime is heated with silica sand (SiO 2) and sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ), a solution is formed that does not crystallize when cooled. Instead, it hardens to an amorphous, clear and nearly colorless solid - namely, glass.
