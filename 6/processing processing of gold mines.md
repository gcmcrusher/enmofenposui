During this time, more explorations will be carried out in addition to gold processing which we will be embarking on within 2 years. These will enhance our sustainability and make our gold mining business a stable and highly profitable venture.

## Making Gold Green: New Non
14.05.2013Nearly all gold-mining companies use this toxic gold leaching process to sequester the precious metal. "The elimination of cyanide from the gold industry is of the utmost importance environmentally," said Sir Fraser Stoddart, the Board of Trustees Professor of Chemistry in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.

## Gold Deposits 
Gold Deposits in Small Concentrations. Gold is one of the most valuable and at the same time rarest metals on earth. It is estimated that up to now only 150,000 tonnes have been extracted worldwide. Indeed gold is present everywhere in the 16 kilometre thick Earth's crust but, is only found in small quantities of ca. 5 grams per tonne.

## How gold is extracted by Cyanidation Process 
17/06/2020Gold Extraction from Mines . Gold and silver are both extracted from the mines using the cyanidation process. This process is achieved by dissolving gold or silver in either a potassium cyanide or sodium cyanide solution. Mining companies also incorporate the use of a technical extraction process in the extraction of gold.
