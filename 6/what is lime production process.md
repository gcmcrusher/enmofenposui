Lime Manufacturing Process. Mainly, there are several processes in the manufacturing of quicklime in lime plant. That is, the crushing process, conveying process, preheating, calcining and cooling systems, and dust collecting, finally the packing process. Firstly, the sifted and washed limestone will be crushed to proper sizes so as to feed in the kiln. Then the feed

## LIME AS A NATURAL CARBON SINK 
The production of lime involves heating limestone (CaCO3) to transform it into high purity quicklime (CaO), releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) as part of the chemical reaction – called 'process CO2'. This means lime production is inherently a carbon-intensive process. The European lime sector (represented by the European Lime Association

## Lime in Flotation and Recovery Processes 
Lime is used extensively in the recovery of gold and silver. Ores, either run-of-mine, milled, autoclaved or roasted, are combined with lime and a cyanide solution. The cyanide dissolves the gold and silver. Lime maintains proper pH in the cyanide solution, keeping it in the liquid phase and preventing the formation of hydrogen cyanide gas and its loss into the atmosphere.

## Lime throughout history 
Lime. throughout history. Nobody knows exactly when humans first discovered lime. Perhaps ancient occupants of Earth used limestone rock to protect their fireplaces. Fire heated the rocks and the first burnt lime was created. It then rained and the lime slaked into calcium hydroxide, which reacted with the ashes and sand around the fireplace
