## Aerodynamic Drag – The Physics Hypertextbook
pressure drag. The force on an object that resists its motion through a fluid is called drag. When the fluid is a gas like air, it is called aerodynamic drag or air resistance. When the fluid is a liquid like water it is called hydrodynamic drag, but never water resistance. Fluids are characterized by their ability to flow.
