01.03.1983Much higher efficiencies were observed for the other sand washing slimes and for the tin tailing, probably because of lower concentrations of dissolved salts in these samples. However, it was found that lower voltages could be used to dewater the more conducting samples, so that the energy requirements for dewatering these samples remained low.
