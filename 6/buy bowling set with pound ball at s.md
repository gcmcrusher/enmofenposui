## How to Bowl a Strike 
14.04.2011The key to consistent strikes is to angle the ball into the "pocket." For a right-handed bowler, the pocket is between the one-pin and three-pin. For a lefty, it's between the one-pin and two-pin. Choose a lighter ball. Yeah, I know. You want to show off your manly strength by hurling an 18 pound ball down the lane like the thunder god Tor.

Also consider your ball weight and ball fit. Not many pros throw 16 pound equipment. With today's core technology, consider rolling a lighter ball. It takes a lot of strength to let a heavy ball swing into a big arc. Sometimes using a ball that is too heavy will result in a smaller swing which will lead to less ball speed.
