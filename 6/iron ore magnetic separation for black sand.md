## Not All Iron Is Magnetic (Magnetic Elements) 
03.07.2019Iron is ferromagnetic (attracted to magnets), but only within a certain temperature range and other specific conditions. Iron is magnetic in its α form. The α form occurs below a special temperature called the Curie point, which is 770 C. Iron is paramagnetic above this temperature and only weakly attracted to a magnetic field.

The iron sand consists of magnetic and non-magnetic minerals as either loses or bound materials. Fractionation of Cilacap iron sand which employed three types of sieve (40, 60 and 80 meshes) showed that the iron sand is dominant in -40+60 fraction (68.38 g) while the most amount of iron and titania contents occurred at fraction of -80 mesh, namely 11.62 and 1.46%.

## Silica and Iron Recovery from a Residue of Iron Ore Flotation
Abstract. A study of silica and iron recovery from the iron ore concentration tailing is presented. The residue is composed of 40.1% Fe, 33.4% SiO 2, 8.31% Al 2 O 3, 0.08% P, and 0.34% MnO. The developed process of silica and iron recovery consisted of size classification, magnetic separation, and removal of impurities by leaching.
