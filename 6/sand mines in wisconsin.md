## What makes a profitable sand mine site 
19.08.2012Finer sand, called "40-70" sand, is sold for natural gas drilling. The second factor that affects the profit margin of a sand mine is how much unmarketable material, called overburden, is sitting on top of the sand. The cost of moving and storing this excess soil can add up quickly, so smaller amounts of overburden mean higher profits.
