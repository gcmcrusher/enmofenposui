Room and pillar mining 07/07/2021 Mining lithium in Russia has hit a standstill because the traditional hard rock method of mining is both cost and labor intensive. For this reason, Russian lithium producers are moving towards the trend of shifting mining methods from hard rock mining to brine extraction methods. For this reason

Planning for the development of room and pillar mines operates in much the same way as other mining methods, and begins with establishing ownership of the mine. Following this, the geology of the mine must be analysed, as this will determine factors like the lifespan of the mine, the production requirements, and the cost to

## UNDERGROUND MINING 
Underground Mining. Underground methods — unsupported, supported, and caving — are differentiated by the type of wall and roof supports used, Room-and-pillar mining is the most common unsupported method, used primarily for flat-lying seams or bedded deposits like coal, trona, limestone, and salt.
