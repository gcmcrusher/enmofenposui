## Understanding the Shaft Manufacturing Process
From custom tooling and fixturing to multi-axis equipment, we use all types of machinery to produce extremely precise shafts to tolerances within 0.0002" (0.00508 mm). FZE's Shaft-Manufacturing Capabilities. FZE works with over three dozen types of raw materials to produce high-quality shafts that adhere to client specifications.

## Shaft Design 
P.R.N. Childs, in Mechanical Design (Third Edition), 2021 4.1 Introduction. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the concepts and principles of shaft design.Specific attention is given to the arrangement of machine elements and features on a shaft, the connection of shafts, determining the deflection of shafts and critical speeds as well as specifying shaft dimensions

## Back to Basics: Mechanical Seals 
27/09/2016A few basic components and principles in mechanical seal design contribute to a working seal at the interface of the rotating shaft and stationary pump/mixer/seal-chamber housing. Mechanical seals are usually end-face seals or rotating-face seals, but in some designs they can be circumferential or even a hybrid of lip-type seals.

Now since swash plate is inclined and block is rotating, the piston reciprocates inside the barrel. The reciprocating motion of piston causes suction and delivery of fluid through inlet and outlet ports which come in front of outlet of piston. If we change the angle of swash plate i.e. θ if a) θ = 0 then no flow of oil, because pistons are at same level. When θ = 0 swash plate is vertical

## Know about rotational directions and numbers of rotation of 
Rotational direction of the motor is defined by the rotation of the shaft as seen from the side the motor shaft projects out. (Figure 2-1) By the way, the spin to the right is commonly abbreviated as CW (clockwise) while the spin to the left as CCW (counterclockwise). Figure 2-1: Definition of the rotational direction of the motor

## Common CNC Machine Problems Solutions 
Poor or Improper Maintenance. CNC machines need to be carefully cleaned and lubricated on a regular basis — otherwise, problems can begin to arise. A lack of cleaning could lead to a buildup of dirt and debris. This might seem to be purely a hygiene issue, but it can have real implications in the machine's output.
