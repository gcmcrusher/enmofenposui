## Magnetite 
Although hematite is more abundant than magnetite, magnetite has the higher iron content, so magnetite iron ore deposits are highly sought after. Economic magnetite deposits primarily occur in layered igneous rocks that formed from the slow cooling of magma, heavy mineral sedimentary deposits, and Early Proterozoic (2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago

The Pao iron deposit in Venezuela occurs as a thirty-meter, intricately folded layer in a sequence of high-grade Precambrian paragneisses of the Imataca Complex. Most of the ore is direct-shipping, high-grade, hard, coarse-grained, hematite-magnetite, but some is of the soft variety. The hard ore ex Abstract - Cited by 1 (0 self) - Add to MetaCart

## Difference Between Magnetite and Hematite
28/01/2012Magnetite is an iron oxide with the chemical formula Fe 3 O 4 whereas hematite is an iron oxide with the chemical formula Fe 2 O 3. Magnetite iron is in +2 and +3 oxidation states whereas, in hematite, it is only in +3 oxidation state. This is the key difference between magnetite and hematite. Moreover, magnetite has higher iron content than

## How To Tell If Hematite Is Magnetic? 
28/04/2022True Hematite, although containing iron, actually has a weaker magnetic field because its iron atoms are aligned. Besides that, mineral magnetite is highly magnetic and is sometimes mistaken for magnetic Hematite. Like true Hematite, magnetite is also an iron oxide, but its arrangement of iron atoms is in such a way as to be magnetic.

## Hematite 
Regardless of its setting, hematite is usually found with other iron-bearing minerals, especially magnetite, goethite and siderite. In Early Proterozoic (2.5 to 1.6 billion year ago) iron ore deposits, layers of hematite and other iron oxides alternate with bands of chert (microcrystalline quartz) to form distinctively layered deposits known as

## Iron ore :: ArcelorMittal Liberia
Our Liberian iron ore is a siliceous goethite/ hematite/ magnetite iron ore, containing approximately 60% Fe, 10% SiO2, 2% Al2O3 and 0.1% P . It is derived from a banded iron formation (BIF), deposited in layers of enriched iron and silica by sedimentation at the bottom of the ocean over many centuries.

5 Magnetite is the main iron mineral in BIF ores, but because BIF consists of alternating layers of iron oxide and silica, the overall Fe grade of a BIF ore is commonly in the range 30-35 per cent. The big Ridley Magnetite project 65 km due east of Port Hedland and also Citic Pacific's big Cape Preston project near Karratha are based on BIF magnetite ores.
