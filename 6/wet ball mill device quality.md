## Ball Mill 
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

## Wet Ball Mills 
Wet Ball Mills are Ball Mills that are used widely in the ore beneficiation industry,as well as the building material industry such as glass.. During the producing phase, the material and water are mixed together to grind in the ball mill. Under the effect of the flowing water,the material will get a better flow ability so the processing capacity will be higher.
