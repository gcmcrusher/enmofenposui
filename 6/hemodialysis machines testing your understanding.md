## Hemodialysis 
Hemodialysis is a treatment that uses a machine to act as an artificial kidney, removing the fluids and wastes that your kidneys cannot. Tubes transfer small amounts of your blood to the machine to be cleaned and then moved back to your body. You can undergo this treatment in a clinic (in-center hemodialysis) or at your home (home hemodialysis

Understanding your kidney disease, or renal disease, is the first step in taking control of your health. When you have kidney disease, your kidneys are no longer able to remove waste effectively from your body or to balance your fluids. The build up of wastes can change the chemistry of your body causing some symptoms that you can feel, and others that you don't.

## Hemodialysis, a type of dialysis 
11/11/2021During hemodialysis, your blood travels through tubes from your body into a dialysis machine. While your blood is in the machine, it goes through a filter called a dialyzer, which cleans your blood by removing some of the waste and extra fluid. Then, the cleaned blood travels through tubes from the dialysis machine back into your body.

## Understanding Your Hemodialysis Access 
Understanding Hemodialysis Access Learn how to care for a hemodialysis access to maximize the effectiveness of dialysis treatments. Many patients living with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergo hemodialysis treatments – a process in which blood is transported from your body to the artificial kidney or dialyzer for cleaning and then safely returned to your body.
