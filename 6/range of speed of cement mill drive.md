## Cement mills 
Cement mill equipment must withstand high vibration, shock loads, slow speeds and a high concentration of particulates. All of which means that contamination, loss of lubricant and even improper mounting techniques can all lead to failures for pinions or trunnions. And, of course, cause costly downtime and repairs, not to mention added safety

The 88mm:28mm ratio triples the torque and scales the speed range down from the top speed to a more useful RPM. I can buy a 6-strand, 60 circumference 600J6 (US numbering scheme) belt for ~$11, and gear down to a simple, plain 12 flat pulley (plywood, crowned a little bit) and get 10x the torque at 10x slower/safer top speeds.
