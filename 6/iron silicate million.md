Silicate Class. The Silicates are the largest, the most interesting, and the most complicated class of minerals by far. Approximately 30% of all minerals are silicates and some geologists estimate that 90% of the Earth's crust is made up of silicates. With oxygen and silicon the two most abundant elements in the earth's crust, the abundance of

30.06.2015Effects of silicates in water. Silicates in water can be beneficial or cause water quality and treatment problems. Natural concentrations can range from a few parts per million (ppm) in surface water to more than 100 ppm in groundwater. Some silicates are in solution, and some are present as colloids that are difficult to manage.
