Reducing the roll gap increases the roll pressure to p3. Gage control in multiple rolling mills is achieved through measurement of strip thickness using x-ray gage and adjusting the strip tension using feedback control system. 1.8 Rolling defects: Mill spring is a defect in which the rolled sheet is thicker than the required thickness because,

Cold rolling is a process that occurs after hot rolling in order to reduce the thickness, increase the yield and tensile strength and pliability of metal. It is a relatively expensive and labour-intensive process, but the improved mechanical properties increase the value of the finished product, whether that is a sheet, strip, or coil.

Having a large diameter back up roll allows the mill to run at high rates of speed compared to an old 20-high mill. To do high reductions on high carbon or stainless steel alloys up to 50% in a single pass, considerable tension can be required. This also reduces the amount of energy that the rolling mill itself has to perform.

A set of requirements for the real-time tension control is suggested. Based on the requirements, a real-time software for the tension control in a multi-stand system is designed and real-time simulation was carried out by using the Vx Works real-time scheduler and the Force Target board.

## Mill Vibration Phenomena during Cold Rolling
The simplest type of mill vibration is found in all mills. It is a forced vibration due to roll eccentricity and so occurs at roll rotation frequencies. These frequencies are usually lower than any of the resonant frequencies of the mill stand.

## The Study of Continuous Rolling Mill Inter
Abstract The inter-stand tension inferential control systems are used to stabilize the rolling motor torque. To stabilize the motor torque the electric drive system with the properties of the rolling motor torque supply may also be used. An alternate option may include torque stabilization by to the effect on speed of the previous, further or controlled mill stand.

## The Calculation of Roll Force and Torque in Hot Rolling Mills
Equations are derived for the normal roll pressure, specific roll load and torque in hot rolling mills, using the condition for plastic deformation in rolling derived by Orowan, together with von Krmn's equation of equilibrium. Although applying strictly to the rolling of ideal plastic-rigid materials, these equations may be applied to the
