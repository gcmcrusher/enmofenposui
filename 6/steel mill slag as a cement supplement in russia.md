The steel sector is still highly reliant on coal, which meets 75% of its energy demand. The energy intensity of crude steel needs to decline by 0.2% annually during 2020‑2030 to attain the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario level. While energy efficiency is important for Net Zero by 2050 alignment, on its own it cannot decarbonise the sector.

## An Overview of Utilization of Steel Slag 
Abstract. The current utilization rate of steel slag is only 22% in china, far behind the developed countries. At present, the amount of slag deposited in storage yard adds up to 30Mt, leading to the occupation of farm land and serious pollution to the environment. Improving the slag utilization is an important way to resolve these problems.
