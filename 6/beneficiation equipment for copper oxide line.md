The main beneficiation way for copper ore is floatation separation. For both copper sulfide and copper oxide, floatation separation can help to get ideal beneficiation standard. However, the plant investment of floatation separation for copper ore is large with high operation cost. This floatation separation is not suitable for some low grade copper ore.
