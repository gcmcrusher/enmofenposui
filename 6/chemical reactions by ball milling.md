Ball Milling in Organic Synthesis: Solutions and Challanges • The scale of the chemical synthesis is related to the type of reaction, the available ball mill(s) and the size of the milling beakers. It is rather recommended to start the reaction at a small scale (≤ 10 mmol) and in case of success perform an up-scaling.

## Quick Answer: What do all enzymatic reactions need activation 
Jul 05, 2022What is required for an enzymatic reaction? An enzyme attracts substrates to its active site, catalyzes the chemical reaction by which products are formed, and then allows the products to dissociate (separate from the enzyme surface). The combination formed by an enzyme and its substrates is called the enzyme–substrate complex.

24/11/2021Despite decades of research, the process behind these reactions remains poorly understood. To learn more about mechanochemical reactions, scientists usually observe chemical transformations in real time, as ingredients are churned and ground in a mill — similar to mixing a cake — to create complex chemical components and materials.

Hybrid nanoparticles with a large bridging organic group were prepared by mechanochemical-assisted sol–gel reaction. Planetary ball mill (PBM) was used for the first time to access the bis-silylated precursors, containing complex functionalities (such as hydantoins or a symmetrical urea obtained from α-amino esters). The process is based on a sequential reaction pathway
