## What order should I buy these tools in? 
May 21, 2021I use 5C collets for the lathe, in collet blocks, in grinding spin fixtures and milling index fixtures. I have a full set of 64ths collets and some square and hex. Also special adapters 5c to BS or MT, expanding etc. etc. The big mistake I made was not buying a full set of round collets in one shot.

## End mill 
An end mill is a type of milling cutter, a cutting tool used in industrial milling applications. It is distinguished from the drill bit in its application, geometry, and manufacture. While a drill bit can only cut in the axial direction, most milling bits can cut in the radial direction. Not all mills can cut axially; those designed to cut axially are known as end mills.

## End Mills. The Essential Beginners Guide. 
1. End Mills cut rotationally in a horizontal, or lateral (side to side) direction whereas a drill bit only cuts straight down, vertically into the material. 2. Endmills are available in a wide variety of lengths, diameters, flutes and types, and are chosen according to the material they are cutting and the surface finish required for the project.

## 5 Best Grain Mills 
The most expensive grain mills are electric models with extremely powerful motors that can produce up to 25 cups of flour in less than 10 minutes. They offer even more texture options, so you can create nearly any consistency you'd like for your ground grains. High-end grain mills cost between $300 and $900.
