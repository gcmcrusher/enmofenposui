## About the Coal Industry
The majority of Canada's coal is produced by surface mining – either strip mining or open pit. Strip mining is only a temporary use of the land and reclamation can be carried out at the same time mining takes place. With open pit mining, once the pit is mined it's backfilled with earth and resurfaced with native trees, shrubs and grasses.
