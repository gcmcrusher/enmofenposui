## Lime and liming / RHS Gardening 
Lime and liming. Liming garden soil reduces the acidity of the soil by increasing the pH level. Plants can't get the nutrients they need from soil that is too acid, and some materials such as aluminium can be at toxic levels in very acid soils. The pH level is a number that describes how acid or alkaline a soil is and from this it is

## Quicklime preparation 
For fine grinding lime hydrate lumps, grinding circuits comprising ball mills and separators are provided. Instead of separators, screening machines are used in case of coarse grinding. The fineness of the products can be set within wide limits (0.01 to 5 mm). The ground products are used in every sector of the lime industry.
