## Technology Interchange 
29.09.2017pProducing a powder coating is a multi-step process. It can be described as being semi-continuous because it begins as a batch process (weighing and pre-mixing) but evolves into a continuous process (extrusion and milling). In the last Technology Interchange article, we discussed the first steps in manufacturing a powder coating. This consists of

## Everything you should know about powder coating finishes
There are two types of powder coating, thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermoplastic powder coating finishes become liquid and very soft when heated. This eliminates chemical bonding. This process makes the powder coating both reversible and reusable. Thermoplastic coatings tend to be thicker, and hence more durable compared to thermoset coatings.
