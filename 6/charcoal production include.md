## Biochar production and by
Charcoal has been produced from woody biomass for thousands of years. In developing countries, traditional earth-mound, brick, and metal kilns are inefficient in producing charcoal and usually do not include burning of the exhaust gases. Therefore, they are regarded as an important source of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions.

Current estimates are that biomass burning accounts not only for 25- 45% of the annual global emissions of CO2, but also for 15- 50% of CO, 3-10% of CH4, and 24% of TNMOC [Levine, 1990; Crutzen and Andreae, 1990; Andreae, 1991].

## Charcoal Production Risks Future of Zimbabwe's Native Forests
15.06.2021Charcoal production is depleting indigenous forests in Zimbabwe where hardwood trees are preferred to make charcoal. Credit: Busani Bafana/IPS. Charcoal – favoured for burning hotter and longer than wood – is made from heating wood without oxygen. The practice is taking root across swathes of the country, dominated by native forest

Charcoal industries in some of the top producing countries, namely Tanzania and Uganda, employ tens to hundreds of thousands of citizens, many of whom receive up to 70% of their annual income from this market [4, 13]. Even in countries where more progressive policies exist with regards to the charcoal industry, producers are still often
