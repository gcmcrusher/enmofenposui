## Heating Screw Conveyors 
According to the hollow-flight principle, screw flights are hollow, so that they provide a path for a cooling or heating medium to flow through. This means that bulk materials that have to be thermally processed, can be cooled, heated or kept at a constant temperature. Screw conveyors with conventional design only allow the heating or cooling medium to flow through the housing

## Advantage and disadvantages of screw conveyor 
10.05.2021Disadvantages. Screw conveyor works at a definite angle. Any variation in angle will lead to its inefficiency. You cannot use this if the materials are fragile or friable. If the material has moisture content or if they are cohesive then it cannot be handled with a screw conveyor. It may lock the moving screws.
