How Copper is Mined. Copper is found alongside many other types of ore. It can be found near gold, silver, zinc, lead, and other types of metal deposits. When mixed in with other ores, copper is not usually found in great abundance. Until the development of the modern copper mining process, it was typically a byproduct of mining for other metals.

In Chile, copper is mostly found in sulfide ores, especially in chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), bornite (Cu 5 FeS 4) and chalcocite (Cu 2 S). The continual exploitation of ore reserves leads to the necessity of mining ores from deeper parts of deposits, often with increasing mineralogical complexity.
