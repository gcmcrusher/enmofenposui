The rated, or nominal, wind speed is the speed at which the turbine produces power at its full capacity. For example the GE 1.5s does not generate 1.5 MW of power until the wind is blowing steadily at 27 mph or more. As the wind falls below that, power production falls exponentially.

Duffy: "A tide mill is quite simply a water mill that derives its power from the rise and fall of the tides. It is almost never referred to as a "seawater" or "saltwater" mill because the chemical composition of the water driving the mill wheel is not important. What counts is that the water impounded behind a mill dam can only be put
