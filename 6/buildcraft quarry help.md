## Pumping water: Buildcraft (Technic Pack) 
Hey guys, I want to empty a quarry which is completely filled with water (dug quarry at sea). I also have a massive nuke crater I want to fill up with water. I've set up a dozen pumps and I'm piping the water to the crater, but the water won't come out of the end of the pipe into the crater.

## Quarry not breaking blocks Issue #2269 BuildCraft/BuildCraft
07.01.2010I've seen this referenced a few times, but I've already made the [BuildCraft] user an Op on the server. No change. The quarry setup is default size, the mining drill just stays on one block and tries to break it over and over again. The cracks appear across the block (this case dirt) as if it was to break, then they would reset and repeat.

How fast can the BuildCraft quarry go? It therefore takes 8 Combustion Engine (48MJ/t) running on fuel to move the quarry head at full speed of 5.2m/s and provide the additional energy of 60MJ for each block broken. A Quarry should be powered with at least 20 RF/t though more energy will help it run faster.
