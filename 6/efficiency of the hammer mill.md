## COMPARISON OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY BETWEEN A ROLLER MILL AND A HAMMER MILL 
AIt is generally believed that roller mills utilize energy more efficiently than hammer mills (Silver, 1931; Puckett and Daum, 1968; Appel, 1987). To verify this, a completely randomized factorial experimental design (CRD) with two replications was constructed: a total of 72 grinding tests was conducted to compare the energy efficiency between a roller mill and a hammer mill.
