## Coking Coal 
The concept involved rapidly pre-heating crushed coal in a riser to about 400C. The resulting mass of sticky particles collected in a retort was then slowly heated to 800−900C. The overall effect was to form a stronger coke than would have otherwise been possible by heating the same coal (or blend) in the same retort slowly from ambient temperature ( Aramaki et al., 1996 ).
