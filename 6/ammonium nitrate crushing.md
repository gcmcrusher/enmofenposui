When heated, ammonium nitrate decomposes non-explosively into gases of oxygen, nitrogen, and water vapor; however, it can be induced to decompose explosively by detonation into nitrous oxide and water vapor. Large stockpiles of the material can be a major fire risk due to their supporting oxidation, and may also detonate, as happened in the Texas City disaster of 1947

Squeezing the pack will make the inner compartment break, making ammonium nitrate and water combine together. When the phenomenon occurs, the process produces an endothermic reaction. Water will break down ammonium and nitrate ions and energy will be absorbed. The cold pack will eventually start to cool and will stay cold for approximately an hour.
