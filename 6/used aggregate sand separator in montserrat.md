## Aggregate Washing 
Aggregate Washing. The washing of aggregates is required for many markets and applications. Nowadays the finished product needs to meet specifications outlined by the ever stringent and demanding world markets. Where dry screening was accepted in the past, washing and scrubbing are now required to produce a silt free product.

## Fine Aggregates: Types, Properties Uses in construction
1.Size of fine aggregates: The largest size that falls under the limit of the exact set is 4.75 mm. Using the largest size will give more dense concrete, but a mixture of all sizes is more desirable and more economical. If cement mortar is prepared for masonry work or plastering work, very fine types of sand of similar size is used.

Gravel / ˈ ɡ r v əl / is a loose aggregation of rock fragments. Gravel occurs naturally throughout the world as a result of sedimentary and erosive geologic processes; it is also produced in large quantities commercially as crushed stone..

1.Size of Coarse Aggregates: The size of the coarse aggregate depends on the use of the concrete is to be poured. For large-scale concreting operations without complex reinforcement, large aggregates of size 80 mm, 40 mm, 20 mm are used. For the simple construction of residential or other buildings, 20 mm is the maximum size will be used.

The majority of businesses or individuals that 'exploit' aggregate within the UK are required to register with HMRC for aggregates levy. Unlike VAT, there is no threshold for registration.
