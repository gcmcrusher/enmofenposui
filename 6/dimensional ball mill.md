Ball mills are characterized by their smaller (comparatively) diameter and longer length, and often have a length 1.5 to 2.5 times the diameter. The feed is at one end of the cylinder and the discharge is at the other. Small versions of ball mills can be found in laboratories where they are used for grinding sample material for quality assurance.

Wet ball milling was used to exfoliate graphite platelets into graphenes in a liquid medium. Multi-layered graphite nanosheets with a thickness of 30 to 80 nm were dispersed into N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and exfoliated by shear-force-dominated ball milling carried out in a planetary mill.

## Confirming Dimensional Accuracy of a Precision Ball
11.02.2021As with most dimensional standards, the accuracy of a precision ball should be roughly 10 times greater than the resolution of the gage it is used to master, and the instrument used to measure the ball should be 10 times as accurate as they are. Consequently, a precision ball is commonly measured to microinches, or even fractions of microinches.
