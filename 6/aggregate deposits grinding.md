## Used Centerless Grinding Machine 
A centreless grinding machine is a stationary tool, with which exact circularities in metal cylinders can be ground. They are used to be able to reach high levels of dimensional accuracy. During the removal of larger volumes, in order to reach the desired dimension, grinding (a form of planing) is used for the final processes to ensure the product has the exact dimensions.
