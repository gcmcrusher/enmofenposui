25.10.2021It has been reported that over 10 billion tons of concrete containing sand fine aggregate, crushed granite coarse aggregate is produced every year globally (Kanojia and Jain, 2017). Therefore, the demand for lightweight concrete has been seen increasing progressively due to its emerging unique characteristic.

## Sand 
Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. Sand has various compositions but is defined by its grain size. Sand grains are smaller than gravel and coarser than silt.Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e., a soil containing more than 85 percent sand-sized particles by mass..
