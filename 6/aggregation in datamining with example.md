24.03.2010For example, we could aggregate this fact table by month. That would involve finding all the sales of Item No. 150 to Customer 1 in, say, January 2012, aggregating the data, and putting the results in a single row. We then, of course, would have to do the same for the other months, the other products and the other customers.
