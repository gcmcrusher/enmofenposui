## Hammermill Crushers 
The Standard and Non-Clog Industrial Hammermills are designed to reduce the material to a nominal 3 to 5 (75mm to 25mm) output. These are primary stage crushers, commonly followed with Centerfeed Mills or other types of secondary stage crushers. The HammerMaster is also a secondary stage crusher in that the maximum feed size is 6 (150mm).

## Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) for Maintenance 
The simple KPI formula is: As an example, let's say we are manufacturing hand sanitizer by the liter. Last month we turned out a million liters of the product for shipment. Our month's maintenance costs were $100,000. So here's the calculation: Maintenance Unit Cost = Total Maintenance Costs / Standard Units Produced.

## Maintenance Capex Calculation 
To calculate the maintenance capital expenditures for 2009 you do 25.4% x $26,808 = $6,809. The $6,809 value is the growth capex so then subtract the result from Capex to get $11,499-$6,809= $4,690. $4690 is the maintenance capital expenditure amount WMT used in 2009. Compare the value of $4690 to the stated depreciation and amortization amount
