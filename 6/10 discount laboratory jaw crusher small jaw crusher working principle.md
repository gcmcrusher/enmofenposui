01.01.2019Fig. 2. Particle size distribution curves of recycled aggregates from concrete pavement crushed by jaw and impact crushers. The jaw crusher produced 85% coarse aggregates (fraction 4.8 mm), whereas the impact crusher produced 82% coarse aggregates. In both cases, the content of particles finer than 0.15 mm was less than 2% mass.
