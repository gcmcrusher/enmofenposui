 Abstract: This article investigates the use of a mesoscale kinetic model to cooperate with the operational optimal control of bauxite ore grinding process. In this article, we propose a new modeling framework where a discretized distributed parameter macroscale model and a mesoscale kinetic model are combined to predict the grinding product particle size.
