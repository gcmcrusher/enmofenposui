Coal Gasification. The process of Coal Gasification chemically transforms the fossil fuel into Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG), instead of burning fossil fuel. It produces Syngas which is a mixture consisting primarily of methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapour (H2O).

## COAL GASIFICATION 
During coal gasification, coal is reacted with oxygen, steam and carbon dioxide to form a gas containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide. During this process, which is essentially incom-plete combustion, the heat evolved is consumed and the sulfur and nitrogen in the coal are converted to hydrogen sulfide (rather than sulfur

## Underground coal gasification 
Apr 30, 2021Underground coal gasification (UCG) is a gasification process used to produce gas from coal in situ by injecting air or oxygen into non-mined coal seams and extracting the product gas via surface wells. The resulting synthetic gas ("syngas") can be used to produce electricity, as well as chemicals, liquid fuels, hydrogen and synthetic natural gas.

Gasification Technology. While the vast majority of our coal is burned at conventional coal-fired power plants, coal can also be turned into a gas for conversion into electricity, hydrogen, and other energy products. Coal gasification is a thermo-chemical process in which heat and pressure break down coal into its basic chemical constituents.
