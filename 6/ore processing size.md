The Kalahari process beneficiates fine and ultrafine iron ore material to produce a 62-66% Fe content. In areas where water is scarce, the process can be coupled with a water reticulation system which produce a dry product, dry tailings and clear water for reuse. The dry tails can therefore be co-disposed, eliminating the need for slimes dams.

Hematite and goethite in the ore sample are closely related with clay forming interlocking complex. This interlocking characteristic continues in the slime leading to considerable percentage of interlocked clay hematite/claygoethite.

Therefore, the first part in any ore dressing process will involve the crushing and grinding (which is also known by a common name called "comminution") of the ore to a point where each mineral grain is practically free.

The biggest characteristic of the sag mill is that the crushing ratio is large. The particle size of the materials to be ground is 300 ~ 400mm, sometimes even larger, and the minimum particle size of the materials to be discharged can reach 0.1 mm. The calculation shows that the crushing ratio can reach 3000 ~ 4000, while the ball mill's

## Kalahari Process for Iron Ore and Manganese Gravitas Minerals
The Kalahari process beneficiates fine and ultrafine iron ore material to produce a 62-66% Fe content. In areas where water is scarce, the process can be coupled with a water reticulation system which produce a dry product, dry tailings and clear water for reuse. The dry tails can therefore be co-disposed, eliminating the need for slimes dams.
