a high field gradient as well as high intensity is therefore an important aspect of separator design. 2. Magnetic Separators 2.1 Design Principles: In the design of any type of magnetic separators, therefore besides a field a gradient in the field strength has to be provided to enhance movement of particles in the desired directions.
