3.2 Shaft speed. The 2nd key design and operational aspect for a hammer mill is the rotation speed. As the milling principle is based on the energy of the impact, the higher the speed, the finer the product can be expected as the particles will hit the hammer at high speed, but also be sent against each other or against the screen at high speed.
