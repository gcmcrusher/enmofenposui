## Prototyping Has Its Place 
01.09.2004In the past, nearly every prototype job was performed on manual machines because setup was easier and faster. As the shop has gained experience with its CNC machines (its first CNC lathe machine was purchased in 1992), prototypes now might be machined on a CNC or combination of both machine types, depending on part quantity and geometry.

## Rapid Prototyping 
CNC machining is an excellent way to make high-fidelity, end-use prototypes from a variety of raw materials. It's fast, accurate, and versatile. It's also easy to make minor changes to the cutting program in order to perfect the final product. CNC machining can also make tapped and threaded holes, which can't be done with other methods.

## Fundamentals of CNC Machining 
Prototype machining emphasizes quick, simple and cheap work holding such as vises, clamps, solutions screws or even glue or -doublesided tape.High production parts allow the cost of fixtures to be amortized over larger quantities to justify the cost of more elaborate and efficient fixtures. This course emphasized prototype fixturing.
