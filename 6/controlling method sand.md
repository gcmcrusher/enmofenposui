Consider the feedback control loop sketched in Figure 1 with the plant model and controller ().It turns out, (20, 21) From (), it is obvious that the system signal pair (u,y) consists of two terms: the first one reflects the feed-forward control and the second one the response to the feedback control driven by the

## SAND CONTROL METHODS TO IMPROVE ESP OPERATIONAL
Sandy wells are a common problem for any artificial lift system. Calculating the correct allowable volume of sand and solids' particle size may be the missing link in optimizing run-times and establishing solid pump performance. Recent Colombian ESP case studies were conducted in fields with high sand/solids presence. Where run times typically lasted 5 months

## Controlling and Costing Materials
The more common methods of costing materials issued and inventories are: First-in-First-Out (FIFO) Costing Method. Average Costing Method. Last-in-First-Out (LIFO) Costing Method. Other Methods-Month end average cost, last purchase price or market price at date of issue, and standard cost. These methods relate to assumptions as to flow of costs.

## Stability of Sand Arches: A Key to Sand Control
01.07.1970Sand production, from a well completed in an incompetent formation without a metal screen, can be attributed to failure of the sand to form a stable arch around the wellbore or over a perforation. This study shows the usefulness of having a sand of high grain strength outside the perforations, and indicates that even a low-strength plastic can provide the restraint necessary
