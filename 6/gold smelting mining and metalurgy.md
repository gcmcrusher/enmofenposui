27.11.2008Uranium ore is mined in several ways: by open pit, underground, in-situ leaching, and borehole mining. Low-grade uranium ore typically contains 0.1 to 0.25% of actual uranium oxides, so extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up

Smelting, on the other hand, involves changing the chemical content of the material. When you smelt, you are "burning off" the other materials that your gold is currently mixed with, creating pure gold. Smelting is a process that can be done with other metals as well, such as copper, silver, and lead. Historically, smelting was used in the

## Smelting gold smell question : metallurgy 
What people were actually mining for would be copper. Gold was more of a by product of copper mining. Make a slurry with mercury and copper ore to dissolve out gold. Then take the result and distill off the mercury and you are left with the gold. So I don't think there would be a particular smell from the process.
