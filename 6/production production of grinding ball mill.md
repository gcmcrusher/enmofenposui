## Milling 
The working principle of the vibratory grinding mill is based on intense motion of the grinding balls, with both inertia and centrifugal forces. The energy produced using the Sweco mill is higher than that produced by the ball mill, making it more effective in reducing the particles size to 0.5 micron or less.

## Wet Circulation Production Mills – Union Process
The circulation Attritor is used for difficult to grind and disperse materials and for the ultimate in micron size and quality. The main advantage of the "Q" series is the very narrow particle size distribution that can be achieved. Large quantities of material can be ground with a smaller investment of grinding media and Attritor equipment.
