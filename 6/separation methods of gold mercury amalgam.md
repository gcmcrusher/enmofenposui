An amalgam is just a mixture of two metals. Most of the time this occurs by melting the primary metal and mixing it with your other components. It is important to note that at the end of this process, a reaction hasn't taken place. It is more analogous to dissolving sugar in water than typical chemical reactions.

A mercurygold amalgam then is formed because gold will dissolve in the mercury while other impurities will not The mixture of gold and mercury is then heated to a temperature that will vaporize the mercury leaving behind the gold This process does not result in gold that is 100 pure but it does eliminate the bulk of the impurities.

20/01/2009Mercury is used in ASGM to concentrate gold by forming a mercury-gold amalgam, which is then heated to drive off the mercury into the atmosphere, leaving only the gold. This process is favored by small-scale miners over other methods of gold extraction because it is inexpensive, accessible, simple to use, and allows miners to produce gold

## Direct and indirect elution heaters for gold and silver separation 
The mercury attracts the gold, forming an alloy called amalgam. The amalgam is then heated, causing the mercury to boil off as a gas and leaving the gold behind. The mercury is collected, recycled and used again in the same process. The carbon-in-pulp method also uses cyanide, but it uses carbon to precipitate the gold instead of zinc. The
