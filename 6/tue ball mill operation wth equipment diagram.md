## Ball Milling 
Ball milling is a mechanical technique that is broadly used to grind powders into fine particles [134–141]. The reactants are generally broken apart using solvent molecules in the traditional method; but in ball milling, reactants are broken by using mechanical forces. The term mechanochemistry has been introduced very recently [142].
