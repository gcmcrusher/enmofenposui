## Vibrating sieve 
Vibrating sieve. A sieve shaker is used to separate powder and grinding balls, crush agglomerates and fractionate a powder into different particle sizes. When equipping a vibrating sieve, a distinction is made between dry sieving and wet sieving. Only dry sieving with a Fritsch Analysette 3 Spartan is described here.

## Sieve Shaker
When stacked on a vibrating sieve, the top test sieve has the largest sieve size and the bottom sieve size is the smallest, which can accurately separate a granular material into 2~7 particle segments at the same time. Commonly used sieve frames for sieve shakers are in three specifications with diameters of 200mm, 300mm, 400mm, etc.
