Bateman's Apic jig is being used in iron ore mines of South Africa and has demonstrated how the technology is suitable for the separation of fine ferrous ores. A Batac jig is installed to reduce alumina content of iron ore fines from

## Iron Ore Beneficiation Testwork 
Ores can often respond to gravity and/or magnetic separation. However, due to the presence of lower-iron content, iron minerals such as goethite, mass yields and recoveries to high grade concentrates can be low. Trade-offs are then required between recovery and product quality (iron grade and penalty element content).

## Advances in Low Grade Iron Ore Beneficiation
iron ore is expected to rise by more than 200 million tonne per year to meet the internal demand export. This additional requirement of iron ore will need beneficiation of low grade ore/fines to get the major portion of increased demand. This paper deals in brief to use of available methodologies for beneficiation of iron ore in Indian context.
