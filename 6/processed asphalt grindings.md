Recycled Asphalt, although a cold granular, tends to pack well and hardens over time. Texas is perfect for this curing process because of our heat and humidity. The tar in the asphalt does not wash off over time, so it retains much of its original properties. In fact, asphalt plants use a percentage of recycled asphalt to make new hot mix asphalt.

## Asphaltica 
Not a grind-up and dump-in process Asphaltica approached the decades old problems and failures of recycling asphalt materials with a novel and practical approach: Recycled asphalt material (RAM). Unlike the prior efforts of "grind it up and dump it in" the hot plants with an oil additive we focused on proper recycling of asphalt pavements and roofing shingles.

## Asphalt Recycling 
08.02.2021Recycled asphalt does not refer to any compromise on quality by any means or its potential durability. Milling is the first requirement to initiate the recycling process. In asphalt milling, experts remove the top layer of asphalt from a surface, such as a driveway or a parking lot, but do not penetrate all the way to the sub-base.

## Asphalt Pavement Recycling 
Asphalt Pavement. While recycled asphalt pavement was not reported separately in these data, generation of "inert solid waste," which consists of concrete, asphalt, dirt, brick and other rubble, was conservatively estimated at 8.2 million tons. The estimated recycling rate for inert solid wastes was 57 percent; the remainder was disposed of.
