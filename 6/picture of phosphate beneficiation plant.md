Beneficiation is a physical process that separates the matrix into its components—roughly one part phosphate rock, one part clay, and one part sand. The materials start out highly aggregated and begin breaking apart while being pumped through the pipelines to the plant. The beneficiation plant may be located as far away as 8 miles from the mine.

## Phosphate Beneficiation 
Beneficiation is the technical term describing the industrial process of mechanically separating minerals from each other. No chemical changes to the minerals are made at this point in the mining process. The phosphate ore, or "matrix" as it is called locally, contains three different mineral groups which have to be separated from each other.
