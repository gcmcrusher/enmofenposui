Limestone is a sedimentary rock consisting of at least 50% calcite (calcium carbonate) with variable quantities of other carbonates, such as dolomite, aragonite, or siderite. Dolomite has been included with limestone here. Fact sheets concerning active limestone and dolomite quarries in Qubec (available in French) References

Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and
