## Efficiently optimise ore sorting • STEINERT
By using ore sorting equipment, ore concentrates can be created at very low cost in small or remote mining installations. The entire processing line can be planned in semi-mobile form and consists only of crushers, screens, belts and sorting machines. This allows immense cost savings for transport, since the waste rock is disposed of on-site.
