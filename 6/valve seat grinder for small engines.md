## Model T Ford Forum: Anybody grind their own valves and seats?
If you want to grind your own valves, check around for an old Black and Decker, Sioux or Snap-on Valve grinding machine. They are cheap, cheap, cheap anymore since hardly anybody grinds valves on modern engines, they just replace the valve. New 350 Chevy exhaust vales run about five bucks each, you can't pay a machinist to grind them for that.
