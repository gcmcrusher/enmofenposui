## Overview on the application of geophysics in coal mining
30.07.20131. Introduction. The origins of the modern-day use of geophysics in coal mining date back to the 1970s and lie mainly in the United Kingdom and West Germany. At that time, the coal mines of these countries were mainly underground. They were getting deeper and the coal was becoming more difficult to win.

Coal mines operated without electricity. Electricity began to be adopted in mining and manufacturing in the late 1880s and the 1890s. (Electricity was first introduced into Ohio's bituminous coal mines in 1889.) The introduction of electricity in coal mines greatly facilitated the introduction of laborsaving machinery. 1891.
