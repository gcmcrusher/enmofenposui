## Kaolin 
Kaolin. During the weathering of intrusive rocks a process known as "kaolinization" occurs wherein the sodium feldspar breaks down into kaolin group minerals – kaolinite and halloysite. Both are hydrated aluminosilicate minerals. Kaolinite (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 ) occurs as plate-like sheets that commonly appear as "stacked books".
