## Phosphate Beneficiation 
During phosphate beneficiation, producers use ArrMaz's anionic flotation reagents to selectively separate the desired phosphate from the gangue with a focus on maximizing the amount of phosphate recovery possible. Just as each phosphate deposit is unique in composition, so too are ArrMaz's flotation reagents.

Tanzania 1,200t/d Gold Mineral Processing Plant. The Tanzania 1,200t/d gold mineral processing plant was an EPC+M+O project. The ore consisted of sulfide (10.7g/t) and oxide (2.4g/t), with Au being the only valuable element. They achieved a leaching rate of 93.75% and 91.58% respectively through the all-slime cyanidation gold extraction process.
