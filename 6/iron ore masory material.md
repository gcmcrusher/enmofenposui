## How is Iron Extracted from Iron Ore 
C + O2 → CO2. The heat produced by this reaction is the main source of heat in the blast furnace that is used for iron production. At the bottom of the furnace, the temperature is very high, which causes more of the coke to react with carbon dioxide, producing carbon monoxide. C + CO2 → 2CO. The carbon monoxide then becomes the "reducing
