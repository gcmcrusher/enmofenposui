## Effect of Gangue Mineralogy on Flow Sheet Design and Plant Operation 
Copper-(Fe)-sulfide ore deposits typically have Cu grades varying from 0.5 to 5%. This equates to approximately 1.5 to 15% sulfide minerals, hence 85 to 98.5% of the remaining ore mass is comprised of gangue minerals. When developing flow sheets and operating a plant, the impact of each gangue mineral present in the ore needs to be
