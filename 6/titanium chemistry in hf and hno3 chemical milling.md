## Hydrofluoric acid 
Hydrofluoric acid is a solution of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in water.Solutions of HF are colourless, acidic and highly corrosive.It is used to make most fluorine-containing compounds; examples include the commonly used pharmaceutical antidepressant medication fluoxetine (Prozac) and the material PTFE (Teflon). Elemental fluorine is produced from it.

## The use of a sequential leaching procedure for heavy metal 
The green liquor dregs were derived from a causticizing process at a pulp mill at Kemi, Northern Finland. According to the leaching studies, the leachability of heavy metals in the water-soluble fraction varied between 0.5 and 2 mg kg(-1) expressed on a dry weight (d.w.) basis, indicating relatively low bioavailability of the metals.
