## Niobium and tantalum 
Niobium and tantalum are transition metals that are almost always found together in nature because they have very similar physical and chemical properties. Their properties of hardness, conductivity, and resistance to corrosion largely determine their primary uses today. The leading use of niobium (about 75 percent) is in the production of high-strength steel alloys used in

## Tantalum 
Tantalum-tungsten (TaW) excels due to its good mechanical properties and excellent corrosion resistance. We add between 2.5 and 10 percent by weight of tungsten to pure tantalum. Although the resulting alloy is up to 1.4 times stronger than pure tantalum, it remains easy to work at temperatures of up to 1600 C.
