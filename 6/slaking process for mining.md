Utilizing a 2:1 water-to-lime ratio, the A-758 unit slakes lime as paste which provides a number of benefits over the more traditional 4:1 water-to-lime or slurry slaking process. This includes less power, faster slaking, a smaller footprint and, most importantly, a more reactive lime slurry solution. Saves Power.

Mar 14, 2016Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime. This reaction is called 'slaking of lime'. This reaction is a highly exothermic reaction. The hissing sound during this process is due to the heat produced. The chemical equation for this reaction is as follows: CaO (s) + H2O (l) ----- Ca (OH)2. Answered by: R.

## Why is there a hissing sound during 'slaking of lime' process 
14.03.2016Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime. This reaction is called 'slaking of lime'. This reaction is a highly exothermic reaction. The hissing sound during this process is due to the heat produced. The chemical equation for this reaction is as follows: CaO(s) + H2O(l) ----- Ca(OH)2
