The Pulverizer works in much the same way as a Macerator from Industrial Craft 2, but it uses Minecraft Joules instead of EU to pulverize things into a powder. It will also work noticeably faster than the Macerator, but slower than a Rotary Macerator. It will turn one block of ore into two pulverized ore. They can then be smelted into ingots, effectively doubling your mining profit.
