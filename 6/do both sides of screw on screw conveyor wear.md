01.04.2000Downstream feeding can be accomplished through injection ports for liquids, and into vents or via twin-screw side stuffers for a wide range of other materials, in filler loadings as high as 80%. This separation of the process tasks combined with targeted introduction often results in less barrel and screw wear with abrasive materials and in a better-quality product.

11.09.2018Backlash is a measurable quantity. The simplest way to measure it in a screw and nut is to push the nut as far as it will go in one direction and then to measure how far it can move in the other direction.
