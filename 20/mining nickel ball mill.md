## High
High-energy ball milling is a ball milling process in which a powder mixture placed in a ball mill is subjected to high-energy collisions from the balls. High-energy ball milling, also called mechanical alloying, can successfully produce fine, uniform dispersions of oxide particles in nickel-base super alloys that cannot be made by conventional powder metallurgy methods.

## Ball Mills 
Ball Mills. Ball mills have been the primary piece of machinery in traditional hard rock grinding circuits for 100+ years. They are proven workhorses, with discharge mesh sizes from ~40M to 200M. Use of a ball mill is the best choice when long term, stationary milling is justified by an operation. Sold individually or as part of our turn-key

## Ball Milling 
Ball milling is a mechanical technique that is broadly used to grind powders into fine particles [134–141]. The reactants are generally broken apart using solvent molecules in the traditional method; but in ball milling, reactants are broken by using mechanical forces. The term mechanochemistry has been introduced very recently [142].

For the mining industry, our semi-autogenous (SAG) grinding mill uses a minimal ball charge in the range of 6-15 percent. It is primarily used in the gold, copper and platinum industries as well as in the lead, zinc, silver, and nickel industries. Autogenous (AG) grinding mills involve no grinding media as the ore itself acts as the grinding media.
