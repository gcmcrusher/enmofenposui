## The Calcination of Kaolin Clay 
While kaolin clay is widely used in its "raw" form, heat treating kaolin to produce metakaolin and other forms of calcined kaolin further increases its usability and creates an engineered product. Calcination can enhance or alter a variety of the mineral's properties to produce a material with characteristics suited to a given application.
