The mining machinery industry will also benefit from rising mining output because a wide range of machinery is needed to keep mines operational. However, the effects will be slightly protracted due to the long wait time on machinery orders, as orders that would have been placed in 2020 were delayed, and companies will therefore see reductions in revenue for a year or more.
