## What is Carbon
Plants and animals assimilate carbon 14 from carbon dioxide throughout their lifetimes. When they die, they stop exchanging carbon with the biosphere and their carbon 14 content then starts to decrease at a rate determined by the law of radioactive decay. Radiocarbon dating is essentially a method designed to measure residual radioactivity.

## Is there any device/instrument for measuring the amount of carbon 
The only way to measure what is sequestered by plants is measure the biomass of the plants. This can be done through estimating allometric relationships between something that is easily measured non-destructively (basal diameter of stem, etc.) and the biomass of the plant.
