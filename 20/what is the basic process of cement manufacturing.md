A. Physical Properties of Cement. 1. Fineness. It is the biggest factor in the strength of cement. Higher fineness leads to higher strength. Higher fineness denotes more area for cement-water reaction increasing strength. Fineness in cement is achieved by grinding the clinker during the process of production. 2.

This cement is a mixture of blast-furnace slag, PC clinker, and calcium sulphate. The amount of blast furnace slag is usually in the range of 80 to 85 % (not less than 75%), while calcium sulphate is added in the amount of 10 – 15%. Overall, the SO3 content of this cement is controlled to be always greater than 4.5%.

It also has a scant contribution in the early strength gain process of concrete. Percentage in Ordinary Portland Cement: The powdered cement comprises about 10% of felite. A small quantity of gypsum is added to the clinkers to further regulate the setting time of cement. However, the percentage is minuscule i.e., about 3-5%.

Cement manufacturing is a source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for approximately 7% to 8% of CO2 globally (1), and approximately 1.8% of CO2 emissions in Canada (2). The cement industry has made significant progress in reducing CO2 emissions through improvements in process and efficiency, but further improvements are limited because CO2 production is
