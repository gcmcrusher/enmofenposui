30.03.2022Mine tailings: Waste not, want not. Traditionally considered 'waste', tailings are just one of a number of by-products generated by the mining industry which are now being assessed for their economic value. For the uninitiated, tailings are created as ore is crushed, ground and treated to extract the valuable metals or minerals within.

## What Are the Benefits of Mining? – Research Summary
Mining is the practice of extracting ore, coal, clays, soils, or minerals from the ground for the purpose of using them. Mines have existed for thousands of years. In ancient times mines consisted of short tunnels dug into the sides of hills or mountains where veins of metals, minerals, or coal had been discovered on the surface. Where Mined Ores and Minerals are Found.

## Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S. Mining Industry 4
4.1.1 Iron Ore Mining There are two basic methods of mining iron ore. These are: • Surface mining or open-pit mining • Underground or shaft mining To be competitive, iron mining must be done on a very large scale. Surface mining is the preferred choice, although there are exceptions. Small, low-capacity mines have rapidly disappeared.
