## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
Home Construction Tips / By happhoadmin7. A concrete mix necessarily contents cement, water, fine aggregate and coarse aggregate. Aggregate occupy about 60 – 70% volume of concrete. In this percentage 40 to 50 % proportion of aggregate is fine aggregate (sand). Fine aggregate selection plays vital role in concrete performance and its cost.
