## Antimony: The mineral native Antimony information and pictures
Antimony is a minor ore of the element antimony, although most antimony comes from antimony compounds (namely Stibnite), which are much greater in abundance. Antimony has a very interesting property: It is similar to water, in that instead of contracting when it solidifies, like all other matter, it expands. For this reason, it is useful industrially: It is mixed with other
