## Iron Ore Pelletizing Grate
Plant overview Grate-KilnTM iron ore pelletizing system The first Grate-KilnTM system pellet plant was installed in 1960. The plant took iron ore concentrate and produced superior iron ore pellets (which are spheres of high iron content and uniform quality) for blast furnace and direct reduced iron feed. Since then, Grate-Kiln systems have been used for over 50 plants, on both
