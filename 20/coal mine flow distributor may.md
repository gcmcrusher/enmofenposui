As the coal seam is extracted, the roof strata cave behind the supports to form the gob. There are many flow paths for gas migration in the gob (Karacan 2009a), and, more remarkably, when there are multi-layers of the coal seams, the pressure-relieved gas flow into the gob from the adjacent coal seams may cause a gas explosion (Yang et al 2014).

Heating - Ventilation and Air Conditioning. Methane is the primary constituent of natural gas and is stored within coal as a result of the coalification process whereby plant material is converted to coal. Due to coal mining activities (and subsequent pressure decrease in coal seams), methane is released from the coal and surrounding strata.

Under different ventilation system, the flow field and gas concentration distribution characteristics of coal mining face are different. Taking U-Shaped and J-Shape ventilation as an example, the physical model of gas flow in coal mining face and mined-out area was established by COMSOL Multiphysics multi-physics coupled analysis software.

Results plotted as mass frequency distributions indicate that a bimodal distribution may exist in areas away from the operations of the continuous miner. A primary size mode of about 17 micron and a secondary size mode of about 5 micron were measured consistently throughout the 10 mines studied.

With those 10 coal/min you can run 11th coal generator underclocked at ~90% clock rate (additional 40-45 MW).

In response to the Paris climate agreement, the Chinese government has taken actions to improve the energy structure by reducing the share of coal-fired thermal power and increasing the use of clean energy. However, due to the extreme shortage of large-scale energy storage facilities, the utilization efficiency of wind and solar power remains low. This paper proposes to
