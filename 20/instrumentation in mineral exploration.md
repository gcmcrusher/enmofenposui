## Mineral resources and resource estimation 
It can be performed initially to assess mineral resources, but also along the mining process to calculate the remaining ore reserves. Different parts of a deposit may contain different concentrations of minerals and structural components and thus, a geological model of the mine allows to adjust the mining strategy and choose the optimal exploration and mining method.

## Resistivity and Induced Polarisation Surveys 
30.08.2013An induced polarisation survey is usually run at the same time as a resistivity survey. The resistivity method can be adapted to an induced polarisation method with the addition of switches and changes to the instrumentation. One of the main advantages of doing the two types of surveys together is to save time as well as associated costs.
