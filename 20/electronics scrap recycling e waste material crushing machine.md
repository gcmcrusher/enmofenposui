According to a UN report, the world generated 48.5 million tons of electronic waste in 2018. This figure highlights the growing importance of recycling, which also throws up some worrying statistics: a mere 20% of this waste is recycled. If we carry on like this, the UN estimates that we could reach 120 million tons of electronic scrap by 2050.
