## Crushed vs Round aggregate in concrete 
03.02.2012I do not have the data, but I would bet crushed rock is better in most or all performance measures. The large aggregate (used in ready-mix concrete) in my area - Northern California - is either crushed 1x#4 - or river rock 3/4. Crushed 3/4 is available at a premium. For high rebar congestion areas, I don't like using 1x#4.

## What is the difference between Crushed Stone and Crushed Gravel 
On the other hand, gravel is rock fragments sourced from an existing deposit of weathered rock, often from rivers and streams, but also gravel pits. As such, gravel tends to be more rounded in shape. The modifier crushed specifies two things at once. First, that the aggregate be angular in shape and not rounded.
