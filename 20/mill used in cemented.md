## Different Types of Milling Cutters Used in Machining Process
We use end mill more in the vertical milling processes. High-speed steel or the cemented carbide are used to create end mills. High speed steel is also called as HS or HSS. The high speed steel doesn't loose its hardness when the temperature increases. Hence, due to better hardness the high speed steel is used to make end mills. The end mills

## Cemented Carbide 
Cemented carbides are especially effective at higher speeds, generally in the range of 45–180 m min −1. This speed can be much higher (300 m min −1) with materials that are easier to machine, e.g., Al alloys, and much lower (∼50 m min −1) with materials that are more difficult to machine, e.g., Ti alloys.

Silk is a naturally produced fibre obtained from many species of the silk moth. In 1700 the favoured silk was produced by a moth ( Bombyx mori ), that spun a cocoon to protect the larvae. The larvae fed on mulberry leaves grown in Italy. Silk fibres from the Bombyx mori silkworm have a triangular cross section with rounded corners, 5–10 μm wide.

These tools cannot be used at low speeds as at low speed the chips of workpiece material are welded to the surface of the tool and increases its wear. Carbides, which are nonferrous alloys, are also called, sintered (or cemented) carbides because they are manufactured by powder metallurgy techniques.
