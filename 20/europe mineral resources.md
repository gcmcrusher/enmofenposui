## Conflict Minerals Regulation
A new EU law to stem the trade in conflict minerals. Therefore, the EU passed a new regulation in May 2017 to stop: global and EU smelters and refiners from using conflict minerals, and; mine workers from being abused. The law also supports the development of local communities. It requires EU companies to ensure they import these minerals and
