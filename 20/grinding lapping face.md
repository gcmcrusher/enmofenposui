The roller is guided by the end faces within the bearing; a very fine surface finish and exact geometry must be achieved. Reduced undulations on the end face significantly improve the smoothness of the subsequent tapered roller bearing.

Introduction To Cylindrical Lapping. Cylindrical Lapping is a two motion (rotation and reciprocation), low pressure, abrasive machining process which utilises a lapping tool along with an abrasive in a compound form. The lapping process results in stock removal ranging from a few Microns to several Tenths of a millimetre.
