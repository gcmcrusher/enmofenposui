## Different Types of Balls: Mass, Elasticity, and Friction
Bocce balls weigh from 31 ounces to 42 ounces (900 to 1200 grams): on the average, a bit over 2 pounds (about 1 kilogram). Here is the graph of a bocce ball dropped onto a hard, smooth floor from a height of just over 25 feet (7.6 meters): As the graph shows, the ball bounces only twice, and does not have much forward momentum, either.

06.10.2021In other words, a sphere is a ball-shaped object. 2. Learn the formula for the volume of a sphere. Use this average value in your volume calculations. 5. Cube the radius to find r 3. Cubing a number simply means multiplying the number by itself 3 times, so r 3 = r  r  r. In our example, r = 3, so r 3 = 3  3

06.09.2004Here's the standard: The diameter of the ball shall not be less than 1.680 inches (42.67mm). This specification will be satisfied if, under its own weight, a ball falls through a 1.680 inches diameter ring gauge in fewer than 25 out of 100 randomly selected positions, the test being carried out at a temperature of 23 +1C.
