14.03.2016Panning is a gold mining method that uses water to separate the heavy gold particles from the lighter materials in the ore. When panning for gold you put your crushed gold ore in a wide pan and then add water to it. You then swirl the pan around with the aim of removing the lighter materials along with the water. The heavier gold particles will remain at the bottom.

Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.

Magnetic separation takes advantage of the differences in magnetic properties of minerals. Most minerals fall into one of these categories: ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and diamagnetic. Among these categories, ferromagnetic materials show the highest magnetic susceptibility, hence they can be easily separated by the magnetic separation method.

## Gravity Concentration in Artisanal Gold Mining 
For centuries, gravity methods were gold miners' preferred separation method as there is a large difference between the specific gravity (sg) of gold (sg ≈ 19.3) and common silicate gangue minerals (sg ≈ 2.7) such as quartz sand. The selection of a concentration equipment depends on several variables, such as the mineralogy of the ore, shape of gold particles, pulp density, pulp
