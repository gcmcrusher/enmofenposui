## Soy crush plant would benefit Manitoba, feasibility study shows
A single use plant — a facility that crushes soybeans only —would need a minimum capacity of 2,000 metric tons per day, which, based on 2014 soybean production numbers, would require between 37 and 55 per cent of current total soybean production on the Prairies. A multi-use plant could crush soybeans and then switch to crushing canola for the remainder of the crop year.

## Could a soybean crushing industry develop in Indonesia?
10.11.2018Indonesia consumed 4.4m tons of soybean meal in 2017. Rabobank says it expects soybean meal consumption to grow to 5.6m tons in that market by 2027 given the increasing meat production in Indonesia. Soybean crushing facilities could be build Indonesia on the back of this growing soybean meal demand, argues the Dutch bank. Soybean meal crushers
