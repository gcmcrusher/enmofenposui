Chromite ore mining and concentration produces overburden and waste rock, dust, tailings and tailings water. Ferrochrome production creates air pollution, dust, slag (waste produced during ferrochrome separation from other ore elements) and process water. These waste materials have the potential to be contaminated with chromium and other heavy.
