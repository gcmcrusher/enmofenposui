## Mt Muro Gold Deposit, Kalimantan, Indonesia 
24.02.2009Mt Muro sold 25,558oz of gold and 71,697oz of silver for the six months to June 2008. While mining operations performed well and delivered over 35,000oz Au to the ROM, the plant only managed to convert 23,200oz Au of ore to leach feed. This resulted in a large build-up of high-grade scats inventory on the ROM, capable of future processing.
