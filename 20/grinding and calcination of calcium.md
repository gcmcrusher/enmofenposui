May 10, 2016 After the calcination process, a considerable enrichment in Fe content was observed this enrichment is related to the thermal decomposition of goethite at 320 C.

## Daswell Lime Calcination Plant 
In the calcination process, when calcium carbonate is heated with high but appropriate temperature, the calcium carbonate decomposes into quicklime(CaO) and carbon dioxide(CO₂). For the manufacturing process of quicklime plant, there are several stages: crushing, calcining, de-dusting and packing.

## calcination of calcium carbonate 
Calcination . The calcination process normally takes place at temperatures below the melting point of the product materials. One of the most common applications is as a step in the production of Portland cement, in which calcium carbonate (limestone) is calcined at around 850C to produce calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide.

## Calcium looping 
Calcium looping (CaL), or the regenerative calcium cycle (RCC), is a second-generation carbon capture technology. It is the most developed form of carbonate looping, where a metal (M) is reversibly reacted between its carbonate form (MCO 3) and its oxide form (MO) to separate carbon dioxide from other gases coming from either power generation or an industrial plant.
