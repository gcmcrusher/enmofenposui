## Original Shellby Found in quarry 
Oct 12, 2015After a many dives and the use of some lift bags to dig thru the pile I found the shellby.. The quarry was heavily shaded and no fish, thus low oxygen levels, bad for the fish but good to help slow rust and decay. Cobra Make, Engine: Time Machines Motorsports LLC- Superformance Dealer.

I also made Filler too. This mod likes BuildCraft, Additional Enchanted Miner(Quarry Plus), Compact Engine, and Akuto Engine. There is no engine, so use a Tech Reborn, Mechanix

Drills, loaders, excavators, trucks and other machinery will need to be in place before you pull the first pound of material out of the ground. Leasing is more expensive in the long run, but in the short-term it is a less costly way for startup entrepreneurs to launch a new operation.

Two abandoned limestone quarries in the guelph area. The south quarry is mostly 10 - 20' jumps. The north quarry has jumps from 10 - 45'. Definately check out the 45' jump. This place is really great for morning sessions, and a cool to explore as there is abandoned machinery in the middle of the north quarry. Overall a pretty sweet place.

In the 70 years that this was an operating quarry, more than 300,000 cubic meters of stone were removed, initially cut out by hand and later with modern stone-cutting machinery.

However, this can be extended to a max of 62x62 mining area with a frame of 64x64 or shortened to a minimum of a 3x3 frame by using landmarks (only 3 are required). The quarry will dig through water down to bedrock; however,
