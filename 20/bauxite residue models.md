## Classification of bauxite residue
(bauxite residue) • What is bauxite residue? • Bauxite residue is a waste of the Bayer process (invented in 1888) which refines bauxite into alumina • Depending on the quality of the bauxite processed, between 1 and 2.5 tonnes of bauxite residue is generated per tonne of alumina procuced (global production ≈ 130 million tonnes per year)

During the design for a drying area expansion at Kwinana in 1998/99, it was decided to include funds for the installation and operation of a full scale prototype carbonation facility, which would allow carbonation of all the residue deposited in this new drying area. This facility was commissioned during mid 2000 and has been the subject of a detailed monitoring and

## Investigation of Hydrological Behaviour of In Situ Bauxite Residue 
Abstract: Over 20 million m of residue from the alumina refining industry are produced in Western Australia each year. The residue is normally stored in engineered earth impoundments termed as Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs). In recent years the closure and rehabilitation of such TSFs have become a very important aspect of overall strategic plans of many mining operations.

Bauxite refining produces considerable volumes of residue, which is generally managed by establishing a vegetation cover for visual amenity, dust and erosion control, and water management purposes. Vegetation has been established on bauxite residue with varying degrees of success due to the high pH and sodicity of the 'soil' medium.

Bauxite residue (or ﬁltered red mud) is a by-product of alumina reﬁning from bauxite ore. It poses problems for the alumina industry due to the huge volume of the residue accumulated (2.7 billion tonnes) [7] and volume produced (150 million tonnes) each year worldwide [8]. The primary potentially dangerous property of bauxite residue is its alkalinity, that can have an adverse

The bauxite residue is mainly composed of iron oxides, titanium oxide, silicon oxide and undissolved alumina together with a - wide range of other oxides which will vary according to the country of origin. The high concentration of iron compounds in the bauxite gives the -product its characteristic red colour, and by hence its common name 'red mud'. A typical chemical
