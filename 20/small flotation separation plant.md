The light fraction is a mixture of small bones and carbonized plant remains. Using a chemical flotation process these two classes of food debris can be separated. The bone can then be sent to a zoologist for analysis, the plant materials to a botanist. Chemical flotation is carried out in the field laboratory or back at the university.

Disadvantages of using a small laboratory flotation machine for testing: 1.Since the test is carried out in batches, the influence of the materials returned between operations and circulation on the test cannot be fully exposed.

## Pulp density and adjustment in flotation plant
07.09.2021In the flotation of various minerals, there is a clear regularity between pulp density and recovery. When the pulp is very thin, the recovery is low, and when the pulp density gradually increases, the recovery also gradually increases and reaches a maximum. After the optimum slurry density is exceeded, the recovery rate decreases again.
