## Heavy metal pollution of soils from coal mines in China
23.09.2019It was evident that soils in most coal mines on the nationwide scale were not contaminated or slightly contaminated by heavy metals. Compared with the previous research on agriculture soils in China (Song et al. 2013), with Nemerow pollution index for 16.67% of samples surpassed 1, heavy metal pollution for coal mine soils were much heavier.
