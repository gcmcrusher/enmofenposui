## Coal types 
Different coal types are all minerals and rocks made largely of carbon.This fossil fuel generates ~40% of the world's electricity and about 25% of the world's primary energy.However, not all coal used is the same; it comes in different quantity levels of carbonâ€”which dictates the quality of the coal. Higher quality coal produces less smoke, burns longer, and provides more energy than

## what is the working principle of drumscrubber 
The drum scrubber is mainly used in the washing process of ore material in ore dressing plant, aims to remove the mud and dust in the ores. In mineral process plant, the mud or dust will affect the ore dressing process, which may block the equipment such as bin, hopper, ball mill, and worsen the separating result.

The coal 'face' can vary in length from m. Self-advancing, hydraulically-powered supports temporarily hold up the roof while coal is extracted. When coal has been extracted from the area, the roof is allowed to collapse. Over 75% of the coal in the deposit can be extracted from panels of coal that can extend 3km through the coal seam.

## How does a briquette machine work 
What is a briquette machine. A briquette machine is used to turn the waste powder into a regular shape block, which can help to improve the conditions for those powder, make them easy for transportation, storage, and more useful for further usage. The briquette system is able to deal with all kinds of materials under suitable sizes and moisture.
