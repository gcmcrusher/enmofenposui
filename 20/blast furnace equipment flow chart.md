The blast furnace is a huge, steel stack lined with refractory brick, where iron ore, coke and limestone are dumped into the top, and preheated air is blown into the bottom. The raw materials require 6 to 8 hours to

## Blast Furnace: Introduction, Definition, Construction, Working 
Introduction. A blast furnace is a special type of cylindrical furnace, which is basically used for the purpose of smelting. So, the industrial metals can be extracted from their ores like iron, pig iron, or copper. The word 'blast' gives the idea of combustion air which is forcefully supplied or produced to the atmospheric pressure above.

9.4.2 Gas Cleaning Equipment. As the blast furnace gas leaves the top of the furnace, it contains dust particles varying in size from about 6 mm (about 1/4 in.) to only a few microns (1.0 micron = 0.001 mm ≈ 0.00004 in.). In some instances where the burden slips in the furnace, relatively large lumps of coke (up to about 51 mm or 2 in. in size) and burden materials have
