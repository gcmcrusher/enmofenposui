We surveyed and sampled each ore body and distinguished five broad varieties of banded ore: 1) equant, medium-grained quartz-fluorite with bands of fluorite containing disseminated monazite, highly variable magnetite, and trace pyroxene; 2) fine-grained aegerine augite bands with variable fluorite, magnetite, and trace apatite; 3) weakly banded magnetite alternating

Massive sulphides are virtually unknown at Black Mountain, with predominantly disseminated pyrite and ore sulphides, within magnetite and amphibole rich quartzose metamorphics. Much of the ore is finely banded on the limbs of the F2 ore fold, with sulphides often present as small grains aligned along the micro banding of the magnetite quartzite and amphibole magnetite rock.

## Banded manganese ore 
Banded manganese ore. This ore specimen is from the largest manganese deposit in the United Kingdom. It occurs in silicates and carbonates within a hard cherty bed near the base of the Cambrian-age Haffoty Formation in the mountains inland of Harlech, North Wales. It is thought that the ore formed in a shallow marine basin under reducing

## Sampling and Estimating Disseminated Copper Deposits
24.02.2016By weighing the samples in and out of water, subtracting the weight of the container in each case, the weight of ore per cubic foot is found by the formula: Weight per cubic foot = 62.5 x Weight of ore in air/Weight in air minus weight in water. Disseminated copper ore averages about 12.5 cu. ft. per ton.

Caving methods. Caving methods include block caving, sublevel caving, and longwall mining.For emphasis, allow me to repeat what I said earlier: caving methods are used in settings where the ore or the host rock is so weak that it cannot support its own weight for any period of time; the methods only work if the rock or the ore will readily cave under its own weight.

filling textures are common in some deposits. Vein ore ranges from fine grained (0.01 to 1.5 mm) to coarse-grained, bladed crystals (0.5 to 2 cm). Low-grade disseminated deposits consist of microcrystalline native gold and pyrite disseminated in permeable host rocks. Secondary mineralogy Telluride minerals are easily destroyed by weathering.

01.12.1997Three general types of ores occur at Bayan Obo: disseminated, banded, and massive ores. Broad zoning of these ore types occurs in the Main and East Orebodies. Disseminated ores are in the outermost zone, banded ores are in the intermediate zone, and massive ores are in the cores of the orebodies.

4.3.2: Underground Mining Methods. Underground mining methods become necessary when the stripping ratio becomes uneconomical, or occasionally when the surface use of the land would prohibit surface mining. Underground methods are traditionally broken into three classes: unsupported, supported, and caving methods.
