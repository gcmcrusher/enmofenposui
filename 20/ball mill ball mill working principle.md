## Ball Milling 
Ball milling is a mechanical technique that is broadly used to grind powders into fine particles [134–141]. The reactants are generally broken apart using solvent molecules in the traditional method; but in ball milling, reactants are broken by using mechanical forces. The term mechanochemistry has been introduced very recently [142].

## High energy ball milling process for nanomaterial synthesis
In particular, mechanical attributed contamination by the milling tools (Fe or WC) as well as ambient gas (trace impurities such as O 2, N 2 in rare gases) can be problems for high-energy ball milling. However, using optimized milling speed and milling time may effectively reduce the contamination. Moreover, ductile materials can form a thin coating layer on the milling tools
