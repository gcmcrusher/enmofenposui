The silicon in solar panels is manufactured through a reduction process in which the silica is heated with a carbon material and the oxygen is removed, leaving behind purer, metallurgical-grade silicon. From there, the grade must be further purified into polysilicon, the solar-grade purity of which is 99.999 percent.

## Six crucial steps in semiconductor manufacturing 
But despite what their widespread presence might suggest, manufacturing a microchip is no mean feat. To make any chip, numerous processes play a role. Let's discuss six critical semiconductor manufacturing steps: deposition, photoresist, lithography, etch, ionization and packaging. Illustration by Aad Goudappel.

salt (NaCl), sodium chloride, mineral substance of great importance to human and animal health, as well as to industry. The mineral form halite, or rock salt, is sometimes called common salt to distinguish it from a class of chemical compounds called salts. Properties of common salt are shown in the properties of salttable. Salt is essential to the health of both people and animals.

Sandstone has two different kinds of material in it besides the sediment particles: matrix and cement. Matrix is the fine-grained stuff (silt and clay size) that was in the sediment along with the sand whereas cement is the mineral matter, introduced later, that binds the sediment into rock. Sandstone with a lot of matrix is called poorly
