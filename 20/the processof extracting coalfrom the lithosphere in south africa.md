## Coal mining 
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is

## What is the biggest source of carbon emissions? How we can
Answer (1 of 28): The implied hierarchy of sources of carbon emissions is not found in climate science where we find the simple theory that CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels causes atmospheric CO2 to rise and cause warming. That's it and that's all there is to it.

20.05.2022Fossil fuels are made from decomposing plants and animals. These fuels are found in the Earth's crust and contain carbon and hydrogen, which can be burned for energy. Coal, oil, and natural gas are examples of fossil fuels. Coal is a material usually found in sedimentary rock deposits where rock and dead plant and animal matter are piled up in layers.
