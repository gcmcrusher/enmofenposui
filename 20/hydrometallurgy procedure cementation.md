## Hydrometallurgy 
23.06.2021Hydrometallurgy refers to the extraction of metals and production of inorganic substances from minerals through aqueous solutions. Although the entire amount of iron, lead, tin, and antimony and major production of copper and nickel come from the pyrometallurgical route, hydrometallurgy plays an important role in the extraction of reactive and rare metals and

## Innovations: How Hydrometallurgy and the SX/EW Process 
The SX/EW Process. The SX/EW Process is a hydrometallurgical process since it operates at ambient temperatures and the copper is in either an aqueous environment or an organic environment during its processing until it is reduced to the metal. Because of its dependence on sulfuric acid, the SX/EW Process is at present not a substitute for, but

29.09.2015Several methods based on pyrometallurgy 8,9 and hydrometallurgy 1,10 are currently used for the recovery of metals from waste PCBs. Pyrometallurgical processes require heating the waste EEE at high temperatures to recover valuable metals. These treatments lead to the production of hazardous gases that must be removed from the air with flue gas cleaning
