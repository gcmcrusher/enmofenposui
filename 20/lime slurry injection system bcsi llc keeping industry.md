## Improvement of problematic soils by lime slurry pressure injection 
Lime slurry pressure injection (LSPI) is a stabilization operation used in problematic soils by transportation industries with the aim of improving the geotechnical properties and bringing excessive maintenance costs to an acceptable standard. This paper presents detailed field and laboratory studies of a lime/fly ash stabilized site at Breeza, NSW, Australia.

## Managing damp problems in old buildings 
Most problems of damp in pre-1920's buildings have been caused since the war, when cement and gypsum plaster became widely available - these two materials are responsible for over 90% of the damage that we see. They are impervious, they trap moisture and cause rot - they are death to an old house.

Air vacuum or pressure is used for moving the fluids between tanks without fluid pumps. The three tanks of the invention include a lime slurry carrying tank 3, a lime slurry dosing tank 7, and a water tank 5 for flushing the system. Compressed air 37 is applied to each of these tanks as needed to push the fluid contents through the connecting

I have only used lime slurry injection on one project. It was a heavy clay soil with a plastic index of 44. The initial soil report literally suggested not building a building in that location.

The majority of injection wells constructed to date have been for one of three basic purposes: injection plus external monitoring for leakage through confining layers near the well (Fig. 14.2); injection plus internal monitoring for leaks in the injection tubing and casing (Fig. 14.3); and injection only (Fig. 14.4). Numerous variations in design have been used to accomplish these
