## Strength of Concrete vs Grades of Cement 
Because concrete gains 99 percent strength in 28 days, it is close to its final strength, so we use this strength at the base for our design and evaluation. Coming back to grades of concrete, the table shows the proportion of cement, aggregate, sand, and water in different grades of concrete. For M5 grade, the mix proportion is 1 : 5 : 10.

## Types Of Cement Grades 
Concrete grades according to its strength and composition, as well as the 30-day minimum strength. Mpa is the unit of measure for the grade in concrete, with M denoting mix weight and Mpa denoting overall strength. Different kinds of mixes (M), which consist of cement, sand, and fine aggregate, differ in the proportions of their ingredients

Here are the five types of cement: Type 1: Is for normal, general use and you will see this most often. Sometimes labeled as "Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC)". Type 2: Is used where cement will come in contact with soils and water with moderate sulfate, or where there are concerns about heat buildup. Type 3: Has high early strength
