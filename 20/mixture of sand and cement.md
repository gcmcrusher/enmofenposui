## Weight of Sand, Cement and Water for Mortar Mix Ratio 1:3
03.05.2019Suppose 1 kg of mortar is to be prepared. Cement:sand ratio is 1:3 and suppose w/c ratio is 0.4; This means of 1 kg mortar, 0.4 part is water, 1 part is cement and 3 parts are sand. The dry sand weighs only 1/1.05 times ie: .952 times of moist sand. Hence, to maintain 3 parts dry sand, moist sand will have to be added in 31.05 part = 3.15 part.
