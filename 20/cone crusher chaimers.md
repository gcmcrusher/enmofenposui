The AF cone crusher is a compressive crusher where feed material is crushed between a fixed concave and a movable mantle. Bigger rock particles are crushed against the mantle and concave. This is called single-layer crushing. When smaller rock particles are crushed between other rock particles, it is called multilayer crushing.

## Prediction of worn geometry in cone crushers 
A cone crusher is used for crushing rock material in mines and quarries. The performance of the crusher changes during its lifetime due to wear of the crusher liners. Previous research has made it possible to model, simulate and optimize the performance of a given crusher. A problem is that due to wear the optimized geometry will change and the performance will suffer.
