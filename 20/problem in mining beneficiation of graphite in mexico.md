Introduction. When I worked for Metallgesellschaft AG, then the largest German non-ferrous metal mining and smelting company, and talked in the seventies of the last century to metal and ore traders—metal prices at the time were about 14 US-cts/lb for lead, about 16 US-cts/lb for zinc and between 45 to 60 US-cts/lb for copper—there was only one overwhelming message: metal

## Purification, application and current market trend of natural graphite 
Sep 01, 2019In beneficiation of graphite by the method of flotation, it has been almost impossible to avoid the entrainment of gangues such as sericite into graphite concentrate. Hence, to solve the aforementioned problem, the use of Nigrosin (C 22 H 16 N 6 O 3 ) as a depressant for graphite in lead-zinc ore processing technology was introduced recently
