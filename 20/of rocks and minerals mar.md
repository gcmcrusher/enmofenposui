## Weathering of Rocks: 3 Types 
Similarly, ferromagnesium minerals such as pyroxenes, amphiboles, and olivines, which constitute about 20% of minerals of rocks, are also affected by hydration, resulting in chemical weathering. Thus, amphiboles are converted ultimately to chlorite by hydration. Weathering by hydration also occurs in arid environments where salts are present.

## Rock Textures 
A rock having such texture is called schist. In addition to the presence of platy minerals, schist rocks often contain deformed quartz and feldspar, or lens-shaped mineral grains among the mica grains. The rock represented in the left photo is a typical schist rock. Schist rocks often contain other minerals, such as garnets.

Weathering is the combination of processes that breaking down of rocks, soil and minerals, eventually transforming into sediment. On the other hand, disintegration or alteration of the rock surface in its natural or original position through physical, chemical and biological processes induced or modified by wind, water and climate.
