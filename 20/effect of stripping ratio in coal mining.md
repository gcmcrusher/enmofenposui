## Coal Ratio 
Contour surface mining takes advantage of the low strip ratio coal reserves adjacent to the outcrop. Contour mining equipment includes a drill, loader, bulldozers, and trucks. The steps in contour mining begin with drilling and blasting a triangle shaped portion of overburden (in cross section) above the coal to be mined.

Effects of coal mining. Surface mines (sometimes called strip mines) were the source of about 64% of the coal mined in the United States in 2020. These mining operations remove the soil and rock above coal deposits, or seams. The largest surface mines in the United States are in Wyoming's Powder River Basin, where coal deposits are close to the

## Stripping ratio 
In surface mining, stripping ratio or strip ratio refers to the amount of waste (or overburden) that must be removed to release a given ore quantity. It is a number or ratio that express how much waste is mined per unit of ore. The units of a stripping ratio can vary between mine types. For example, in coal mining the stripping ratio is commonly referred to as volume/weight.

26.07.2017The units for stripping ratios can vary and usually depends on the geological properties of the deposit and the commodity mined.
