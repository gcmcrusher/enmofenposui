## Grading of Fine Aggregate 
The Fineness Modulus is used in US practice and is a measure of the grading of fine aggregates. It can be calculated from a sieve analysis by adding the cumulative percentages of fine aggregates retained on the following sieve sizes; 0.15mm, 0.30mm, 0.60mm, 1.18mm, 2.36mm and 4.75m. This value is then divided by 100 to give the fineness modulus.
