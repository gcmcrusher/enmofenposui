Cemstone (BS EN 197-1 – CEM Il / A-L 52,5 N) CEMEX Cemstone is a factory produced Portland-limestone cement with a lower carbon footprint that complements our range of Portland (CEM I) cements. CEMEX Cemstone provides benefits in a wide range of concrete, mortar, render, screed and grout applications.

Limestone, often considered an inert filler when added to portland cement, is not completely chemically inert and contrib-utes to the development of the concrete`s microstructure (FHWA 2011).

The effect of particle size reduction on the burn ability of Limestone was investigated using the limestone obtained from Obajana Cement Mines. Limestone samples were grinded and were classified into following particles size distribution: 90m, 200m, 250m and 500m graduated in different sieve sizes.

Mix 1 has limestone fillers (F) which has the same fineness as the cement particles (C). Mix 2, on the other hand has limestone fillers which are much finer than the cement particles. It can be observed from the diagrams on the right that Mix 2 achieved a better packing of particles as opposed to Mix 1, leading to more excess water in Mix 2.
