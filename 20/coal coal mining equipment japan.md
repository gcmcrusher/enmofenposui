When coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal using open-cut (also referred to as open-cast, open-pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the

## Coal 
Coal is a combustible rock of organic origin composed mainly of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, with lesser amounts of nitrogen, sulfur and other elements. Varying amounts of water are always present, as are grains of inorganic matter that form an incombustible residue known as ash. Coal is formed by the accumulation and decomposition of plant

## Prices and costs 
Decreasing diesel prices cut coal mining operating costs, especially for operators of opencast mines that rely on diesel trucks and other equipment. Low fuel costs particularly benefit countries with mainly opencast mines such as in Indonesia. Average fuel costs declined in 2019 due to lower diesel prices.

## A closer look at eight of the worst coal mining disasters in history
14.11.2019The disaster is considered to be the second-worst coal mining disaster in Japan after the Mitsubishi Hojyo coal mine disaster that occurred in 1914. A massive blast, which was caused by a coal dust explosion nearly 500m below the mine's ground level entrance, led to collapse of the tunnel roof at various locations in the mine.

## Role of Tectonic Coal in Coal and Gas Outburst Behavior During Coal Mining
21.05.2019Coal and gas outbursts are small-scale geological disasters controlled by tectonic movement, and tectonic coal is widespread in outburst zones. In this study, we compare tectonic and intact coal specimens to examine the basic properties of tectonic coal. We estimate the different energies and limits of the crushing work ratio of coal from five typical outburst cases

## Coal 
20.10.2015According to Japan Development Institute (JDI)'s 2009 reports, regardless of the comparatively small size of coal reserves found in Cambodia so far, there still may be enough to supply coal for a 400 megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant for 30 years or more. 3. Several companies have expressed intentions to explore for coal.

## Coal
Underground coal mining is the extraction of coal from below the surface of the earth. The coal is worked through tunnels, passages, and openings that are connected to the surface for the purpose of the removal of the coal. Mechanical equipment breaks the coal to a size suitable for haulage. Alternatively, the coal is drilled, and the resultant
