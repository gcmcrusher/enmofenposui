Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with water and steel balls.

## STUDY MATERIAL 
Open pit Mining method • Mine working open to the surface. • Funnel shaped hole in ground, with ramp spiraling down along sides, allows moderately deep ore to be reached. • Operation designed to extract minerals that lie close to the surface • It is used when the ore body is near the surface and little overburden (waste rock) needs to be removed.

The quarrying process consists of separating large blocks, sometimes called loafs, from the surrounding rock. These blocks may be 6 metres high by 6 metres deep and 12 to 18 metres (about 40 to 60 feet) long, and they may weigh in the range of 1,200 to 2,000 tons. (Such large blocks are subsequently divided into mill blocks weighing 15 to 70 tons.)

Cameco Fuel Cycle - Milling. Uranium ore is simply rock with elevated amounts of uranium in it. Once the rock has been removed by open pit or underground mining it must be milled to separate the uranium from other constituents. The milling process for uranium is similar to that used for other metals such as copper, gold or nickel.

## Heap leaching 
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals, copper, uranium, and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re-separate them after their division from other earth materials. Similar to in situ mining, heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner, then adds the chemicals via drip systems
