## How the global steel industry is cutting out coal 
01.05.2021Companies like SSAB have developed plans to eliminate coal from their steel plants. In place of coke, derived from coal, the company plans to use clean hydrogen. Like carbon, hydrogen can also strip oxygen from iron ore to make the pure iron needed in steel-making. But in this reaction, the resulting "emission" is H20.
