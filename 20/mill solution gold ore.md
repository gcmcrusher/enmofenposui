## Cyanide Use in Gold Mining 
How is cyanide used in mining? A sodium cyanide solution is commonly used to leach gold from ore. There are two types of leaching: Heap leaching: In the open, cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads. The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap.

## Gold extraction 
The solubility of gold in a water and cyanide solution was discovered in 1783 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, but it was not until the late 19th century, that an industrial process was developed.The expansion of gold mining in the Rand of South Africa began to slow down in the 1880s, as the new deposits being found tended to be pyritic ore.The gold could not be extracted from this

A process whereby gold is extracted by "heaping" broken ore on sloping impermeable pads and continually applying to the heaps a weak cyanide solution which dissolves the contained gold. The gold-laden solution is then collected for gold recovery. High grade: Rich ore. As a verb, it refers to selective mining of the best ore in a deposit.

## Leaching of gold from a free milling gold ore in copper
15.08.2020In this research, a free milling gold ore is leached using copper-citrate-thiosulfate solutions at elevated temperatures, where citrate serves as a stabilizer of cupric ion. Experimental factors such as agitation speed, temperature, initial pH, concentration of copper, citrate and thiosulfate have been investigated.

The effect of pH value on gold extraction for various ore types is shown in Figure 28.4. Greatly increasing pH value has a beneficial effect on gold extraction for both oxide and sulfide ores and stabilizes âˆ¼pH 9.5â€“10.0, whereas for some carbonaceous ores, pH value has no apparent effect.

For the mining industry, our semi-autogenous (SAG) grinding mill uses a minimal ball charge in the range of 6-15 percent. It is primarily used in the gold, copper and platinum industries as well as in the lead, zinc, silver, and nickel industries. Autogenous (AG) grinding mills involve no grinding media as the ore itself acts as the grinding media.
