Optimization of Cement Grinding Operation in Ball Mills. Changing the separator to a high efficiency type brings about better residue value (on 45 micron) for the same Blaine. Alternatively, the cement can be ground to a lower Blaine with the same residue, which determines the strength of cement.

The most common technique is the Blaine specific-surface method, which measures the resistance of compacted particles to air flow. ASTM C204 describes this method for measurement of the surface area of Portland cement. Reactivity of fly ashes increase with fineness, particularly the fraction passing 45 ц sieve.

What is residue and Blaine in cement? - Quora. Answer: When cement is manufactured the final process is the grinding of the clinker to form powder. The fineness of this powder is an important property. The finer the grinding the higher the specific surface. The Blaine of cement refers to the fineness of its particles and is expressed as (m2/k

In the past, cement producers gauged cement fineness (i.e., cement particle size) by evaluating the specific surface area (SSA) or Blaine fineness and the sieve residue at various sizes. However, many producers now use particle size analysis techniques to assess fineness and help monitor the efficiency of the mill.
