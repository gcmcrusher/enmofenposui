23.10.2019Stinkdamp - Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) Stinkdamp is the mining term given to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) due to its characteristic smell of rotten eggs. Hydrogen sulfide is a highly poisonous, flammable, colourless, and as mentioned, pungent-smelling gas. It has only ever been found in trace amounts in mines - but it can be lethal in even small

Once the mining begins, the drilling exposes sulfide tailings —the waste left over after metals have been removed from ore—to the outside environment. Once air and water come in contact with the tailings, a chemical reaction produces sulfuric acid.

## Sulfide Mining, Mining Methods, Techniques, Copper, Zinc, Lead, 
Sulfide Mining. Mining is the method of tacking materials from the earth to get valuable metal ores like copper, zinc, and lead, which are known as target minerals in mining terms. Metal ores like copper, zinc and lead are minute quantities

## getting political: PolyMet and sulfide mining 
28.01.2011Metallic sulfide mining (also known as nonferrous mining or hard rock mining) is the process of extracting minerals like copper and nickle from a sulfide ore body. When the ore or surrounding rocks are exposed to water or air the result is sulfuric acid. The runoff from the mine site can pollute surface and ground water, killing or sickening wild vegetation, fish, birds and

## Copper Mining Devastated Montana. Now An Industry 
05.07.2019A major risk of sulfide mining is the potential for acid mine drainage. When sulfide-bearing minerals are exposed to air and water they can break down, creating sulfuric acid. Once in motion, this acid leakage can persist indefinitely and wreak havoc on aquatic ecosystems. One need look no further than the Zortman-Landusky mines, a pair of

## Sulfide Mining – Minnesota Trout Unlimited
• Noise, dust and light pollution from 24-hour-a-day, 365-day-a-year mining operations would affect animal behavior and the quiet fishing experience. • Mine infrastructure and additional road traffic would lead to forest fragmentation, which disrupts wildlife travel corridors and accelerates the spread of weedy invasive species, which change the forest character.

Once the ore is removed from veins (narrow channels) or lodes (roughly spherical deposits) in the Earth, usually at depths of about 60 metres, the ore is treated at concentrating mills. Here the ore is finely crushed, sometimes to particle diameters of less than 0.1 millimetre (0.004 inch), and then treated by one of several mineral concentration processes. Such processes are designed
