## Copper Environmental Profile 
copper mining: surface and underground mining. Due to copper being spread in relatively low concentrations over large areas, surface, or open-pit mining, is the predominant mining method for copper in the world. After mining, copper is produced by one of two process routes: pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical. Within the pyrometallurgical

26.09.2019The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.

Copper - From Beginning to End. Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man. It is found in ore deposits around the world. It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago. And as alloyed in bronze (copper-tin alloy) about 3000 BC, was the first engineering material known to man.
