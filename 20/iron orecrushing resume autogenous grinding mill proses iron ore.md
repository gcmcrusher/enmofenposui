2.The smaller crushed iron ore is fed to ball mill for grinding. Inside the ball mill, the crushed iron ore will grind the ore to about 0.2 mm with 3-inch steel balls. 3.This iron ore slurry is pumped to the agitation tank. This iron ore slurry is finally pumped to the flotation machine with the fine sulfide ore (~-0.074 mm) going to froth

## Comminution and classification technologies of iron ore
01.01.2022Most of the high-grade hematite iron ores are typically subjected to simple dry processes of crushing and classification to meet the size specifications required for direct shipping ore (DSO). This involves multistages of crushing and screening to obtain lump (−31.5 + 6.3 mm) and fines (approximately −6.3 mm) products.
