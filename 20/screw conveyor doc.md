## Cooling
According to the hollow-flight principle, screw flights are hollow, so that they provide a path for a cooling or heating medium to flow through. This means that bulk materials that have to be thermally processed, can be cooled, heated or kept at a constant temperature. Screw conveyors with conventional design only allow the heating or cooling medium to flow through the housing
