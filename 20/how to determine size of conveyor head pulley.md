## What Are the Different Types of Conveyor Pulleys?
19.07.2020Motorized Pulleys. If you get a conveyor pulley that has an internal motor, you can both improve the efficiency of your operations and save some space. With a motorized pulley, your conveyor system will stay durable and compact. This is often a safer option than a traditional hydraulic conveyor system. Conveyor Head Pulley.

26.06.2018This means the pulley ratio must be .611 to drive the pump correctly. Hypothetically speaking, if we had a 4 inch pulley on the motor, we would require a 6.55" pulley on the pump. That mathematical equation is as follows: 4" divided by .611 = 6.55". For the same pump, driven by a gas engine, 1070 (pump RPM) divided by 3400 (engine RPM

07.02.2004Superficially, any combination of the following factors may play a role: 1. The OD and gearbox ratio is often combined to determine the conveyor speed (where a specific speed is required). 2.

## Conveyor Belt Maintenance Common Conveyor Problems
Pulley problems. Pulleys are a common source of tension issues. Worn heads or pulleys with buildup can reduce the belt's grip, as can a pulley that's too smooth. The best way to prevent pulley problems is to actively check them for signs of wear. When your conveyor belt constantly slips, it disrupts your daily operation and productivity. If
