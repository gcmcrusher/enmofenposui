## Coal Spontaneous Combustion, Kenaikan Moisture Batu Bara
Cara coal compacting ini memiliki beberapa kelemahan, yaitu: Coal compacting selain memiliki kelemahan seperti tersebut di atas, juga tidak bisa mencegah keanaikan moisture jika terjadi hujan. Solusi yang efektif untuk mencegah coal spontaneous combustion (swabakar batu bara), sekaligus mencegah kenaikan moisture batubara adalah dengan cara

## Propensity of coal to self
coal quality: low carbon content and large amounts of volatile components support combustion; coal moisture content; particle size: the smaller the particles, the larger the surface area, the higher the risk. Walters (1996) discussed the theory and practical implications of coal self-heating. Using analytical data from the late 19th

## Spontaneous Coal Combustion Part 2: Chemical Inhibitors
Facilities responsible for handling subbituminous coals, such as PRB coal, can apply chemical inhibitors at transfer points to retard spontaneous combustion in trains, on barges, in storage piles, and in coal yards. Inhibitors are sprayed at transfer points to evenly treat the full body of the coal stream as it tumbles down and is spooned onto the next conveyor. This allows for

The self-heating of coal-shale has been reported to be the likely source of spontaneous combustion in selected bands of a coal seam, highwalls and spoil heaps in Witbank, South Africa (as shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3).Spontaneous combustion of coal has been extensively studied in underground and opencast mines of South African mines using

## Application of fault tree analysis to coal spontaneous combustion
The initial branches of the spontaneous combustion fault tree are shown in Figure 1. Three primary causes of a spontaneous combustion event developing have been identified. These are self-heating (in response to the mining process), less than adequate dissipation of heat and a less than adequate monitoring system. All three of these

## 
Avoiding spontaneous combustion in the milling process is essential for personnel safety and asset protection. The greatest risk of spontaneous heating and subsequent fire occurs when the mill is shut down under load, as this leaves a large amount of pulverised fuel inside a hot mill. The large surface area of the pulverised coal and the high temperature inside the mill can
