## How to Make Chain Mail Armor from Start to Finish
10.08.2010This article is a guide for making Chainmail Armor from start (simple wire) to finish (a finished chainmail shirt). We will be using the European 4 in 1 weave, as this is the most common weave. This is the weave that you usually see in movies. There are several sections to this guide: Materials, Making the Rings, Weaving the Rings, and Making the shirt.

HP steam is exhausted at vacuum conditions and is condensed against a cooling utility. Steam turbines typically rotate at 3,000–15,000 rpm. At that speed, water droplets can form and unbalance the turbine blades, causing severe mechanical damage. BPSTs can usually operate safely at up to 3% moisture ( i.e., a minimum steam quality of 97%).
