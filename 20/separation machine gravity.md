## Gravity Separation 
Gravity separation has been applied to process chrome slag by steel researchers in India. Heavy media separation (Choudhury et al., 1996) and crushing and jigging (Khan et al., 2001) are the principal techniques used. The slag is subjected to 2-stage crushing to reduce the size to −10 mm and then screened into −10 +1 mm and −1 mm fractions.

Gravity separation is an industrial method of separating two components, either a suspension, or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical: i.e. the components of the mixture have different specific weight. All of the gravitational methods are common in the sense that they all use gravity as the dominant force.
