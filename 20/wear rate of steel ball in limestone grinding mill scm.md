The wear of steel balls in continuously operated grinding mills, used in mineral processing to comminute metalliferous rocks, can be described by a simple population-balance model. This model gives rise to a scalar transport equation with a singular source term for the number density of balls as a function of size and time. Exact solutions to this equation are determined under

## Ball Mill 
D. Sumanth Kumar, H.M. Mahesh, in Synthesis of Inorganic Nanomaterials, 2018 3.6.1.1 Ball Milling. A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend bulk material into QDs/nanosize using different sized balls. The working principle is simple; impact and attrition size reduction take place as the ball drops from near the top of a rotating hollow cylindrical shell.
