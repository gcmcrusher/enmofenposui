The relative depth of the deposit and economic value of the mineral play a key role in determining which method of mining to be used. An underground mine could be as shallow as 300 meters or as deep as 3 kilometers. For example, earth's deepest underground mine, Mponeng Gold Mine, located in South Africa, has an operating depth beyond 3.1 km.

Surface mining. Surface mining is exactly what the word says - digging rocks out from the surface, forming a hole or pit. In South Africa, this method is used to mine for iron, copper, chromium, manganese, phosphate and coal. Surface mining is also known as open pit or open cast mining. An open pit coal mine.
