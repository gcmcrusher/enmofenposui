Bauxite Ore. Bauxite is an ore of aluminium in the hydrated forms of alumina (aluminium oxide, Al 2 O 3). It also contains small portions of iron oxides, titanium dioxide, silica, clays of alumina, etc. The two types of Bauxites ores found in the Earth's surface are: 1. Laterite (silicate bauxite) 2.

The ore is characterized by the fine combination of fine-grained hematite and chlorite and boehmite, and the ore is brittle. After the ore dressing is sieved and washed, the coarse grade is subjected to selective crushing and then classified, and the coarse fraction is a low aluminum to silicon ratio product.
