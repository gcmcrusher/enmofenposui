What are the factors that affect the efficiency of equipment operation? 1. Whether the daily maintenance of the equipment is thoughtful or not directly affects its work efficiency: For example, if lubrication is not maintained, the operating speed of the equipment bearings will be reduced, thereby greatly reducing the efficiency of the entire equipment.

## The energy efficiency of ball milling in comminution
01.11.2002In terms of this concept, the energy efficiency of the tumbling mill is as low as 1%, or less. For example, Lowrison (1974) reported that for a ball mill, the theoretical energy for size reduction (the free energy of the new surface produced during grinding) is 0.6% of the total energy supplied to the mill setup.
