## Innovations: Newly Mined Copper: Why Do We Need It?
Scrap is already in a metallic form, so we can think of it as containing all of the energy previously expended to mine, crush, transport, smelt and refine copper ore. Very little of that energy need be expended again since the re-melting and re-refining of scrap are relatively clean, efficient processes. High-quality scrap also costs about 10% less than new refined cathode copper.
