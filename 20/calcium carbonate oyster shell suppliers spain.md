## Preparation of vaterite calcium carbonate granules from discarded 
01/09/2020We used discarded oyster shells to prepare vaterite calcium carbonate microparticles and explored the removal effects and the underlying mechanism toward several heavy metal ions. The removal efficiency for each ion type was: Pb 2+ (99.9%), Cr 3+ (99.5%), Fe 3+ (99.3%), and Cu 2+ (57.1%).
