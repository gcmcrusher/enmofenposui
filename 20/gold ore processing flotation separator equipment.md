01.01.2016Flotation separation was more consistent with lead, and the presence of lead in the cyanide leach circuit did not noticeably impact cyanide consumption. The rougher flotation tailing contained low enough gold values to be pumped directly to the tailings dam. The flotation concentrate was finely ground before cyanide leaching.

Gold ore flotation of large density, coarse particle size of the mineral, often with more concentrated pulp;On the contrary, thinner pulp is used when flotation of small density, fine particle size and slime. Higher recovery rate can be guaranteed by using thicker pulp in rough separation. Cleaning with a thinner concentration is beneficial to improve the concentrate quality.
