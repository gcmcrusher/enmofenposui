A grinding mill is provided. The mill uses a substantially two-dimensional system for producing gyratory motion in a dish for the purpose of rotating a puck within the dish. The system includes a spin-disk having a circular off-center cavity for holding a dish holder fixedly containing a dish. When the spin-disk is rotated, the dish holder orbits about a point other than its center point,

## Jet mill working principle 
Jet mills have no moving parts, thereby eliminating contamination due to contact with external grinding media. It is also an ideal process to grind heat-sensitive and waxy material because no attritional heat is generated. Jet mill works on fluid energy. Consider a pancake spiral jet mill as an example. Micronizing and classification take place

## Ball Mill 
The working principle is that cement is removed from the mill before over-grinding has taken place. The cement is then separated into a fine fraction, which meets finished product requirements, and a coarse fraction which is returned to mill inlet. Recirculation factor, that is, the ratio of mill throughput to fresh feed is up to three. Beyond this, efficiency gains are minimal.
