## The hole story: the benefits of drill and blast 
Ideally, most coal mines want to have a small amount of hard toe by standing off the coal by a small amount. This protects the coal seam during the blast, avoiding dilution of the overburden material with the coal seam. Drilling to elevation is also important when the blast design requires a level bench as a result.
