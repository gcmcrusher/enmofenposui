## Transforming Industry through CCUS 
In the cement sector, implementation of strong material efficiency measures in the CTS leads to a 5% reduction in global cement demand in 2030 compared to RTS levels, which contributes to relatively slow CCUS uptake over the coming decade. However, a rapid increase in CO 2 capture levels occurs from 2030, to reach 0.4 GtCO 2 by 2060.

## IPCC report: 'Code red' for human driven global heating, warns 
09.08.2021The UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres said the Working Group's report was nothing less than a code red for humanity. The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable. He noted that the internationally-agreed threshold of 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels of global heating was perilously close.
