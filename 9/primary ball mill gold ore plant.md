Of the numerous major gold mining operations around the world, most utilize a primary crushing circuit which flows into a SAG mill circuit and then a ball mill circuit. The primary reason for the significant comminution circuits is because in gold mining the grades are notably low and thus excessive waste material is present, resulting in high mill feed rates. If the ore rock is highly
