The condition of your chips is also important information. When grinding, the workpiece is ground by the cutting edges of abrasive grains, discharging fine chips. The shedding, glazing, etc. of grinding wheel occur from the relationship between this chip shape and each cutting edge of abrasive grain. This phenomenon occurs from a constant timing.

Chipping leads to reductions in the biomass size to 10–30 mm while grinding results in a particle size of 0.2 mm. However, no significant effect on the rate

## Coffee Grind Size How It Affects Consistency Flavor
01/12/2017The whole purpose of grinding our coffee beans is to increase the surface area coming into contact with water. And the finer or coarser the grind, the more or less quickly water can pass through it – affecting brew time as well as extraction efficiency. A coarser grind has looser particles which, in turn, will allow water to move between them

## Which Grinding Wheel Should I Choose? 
21/11/2018For this reason, finer grit sized wheels are required to grind hard materials and soft materials are best ground with medium to coarse grit size wheels. For most efficient operation, the grade must be adjusted to suit the hardness of the material. As a general guide, the harder the material, the softer the grade of wheel required.

## Metallographic grinding and polishing insight 
Embedded abrasives can occur because of a small abrasive particle size, the grinding or polishing cloth used has a low resilience, or a lubricant with a low viscosity is used. Often, a combination of these reasons takes place. When plane grinding, abrasive particles can become embedded in soft materials. Continue with a somewhat finer grit
