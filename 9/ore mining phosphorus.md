The sediments above the phosphate ore being mined are collectively called overburden. The overburden is removed in two steps. The upper overburden is first removed to a depth of 35 to 50 feet. This step in the mining process is referred to as pre-stripping. The mining operations currently use backhoe excavators and 40-ton haul trucks to

## Phosphate Rock 
Rock phosphate. Rock phosphate is a naturally occurring ore of marine sedimentary origin. It may have a composition of 0-30-0, but the grade is noted as 0-3-0, since rock phosphate is sparingly soluble and little of the phosphorus is available to crops. Many of the mines that produced rock phosphate are closed, and most of the marketed rock

ore, a natural aggregation of one or more minerals that can be mined, processed, and sold at a profit. An older definition restricted usage of the word ore to metallic mineral deposits, but the term has expanded in some instances to include nonmetallics. Although more than 2,800 mineral species have been identified, only about 100 are considered ore minerals. Among these are
