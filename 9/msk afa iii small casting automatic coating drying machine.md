## Die Casting 
The hot chamber process (Fig. 1(b)) is used extensively for casting smaller parts with shot weights up to 2–3 kg. Static metal pressures are usually smaller than in cold chamber machines, typically in the range 20–30 MPa (2900–4400 psi). Casting temperatures vary from one alloy to another and also depend upon the casting process.
