## Technology and work practices 
The opening chapter of this book considered the concept of ore, as it would have applied in prehistory. The modern definition is essentially an economic one that relates the cost of mining a mineral deposit to perceived financial returns or strategic interests. The effort of extraction must be set against the concentration or 'grade' of metal present in the rock, which will determine

## Disadvantages Open Pit Copper Mining 
Open pit mining, copper mine tailings, leaching products, and deposits of toxic metals in the environment often raises concerns and sometimes public outrage. In addition, consumers may fear that copper alloys utilized as antimicrobial surfaces in food production will lead to copper toxicity in humans.

Figure 2: Overview of a typical beneficiation process at a concentrator Sulfidic copper ores are too dilute for direct smelting. Smelting these materials would require too much energy and very large furnace capacities. The copper ore coming from the mine (0.5 – 1 % Cu) must be concentrated by beneficiation.
