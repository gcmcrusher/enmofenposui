## beneficiation process of ore mineral processing
Beneficiation. 11.5.3.1 Beneficiation. Mineral beneficiation begins with crushing and grinding of mined ore for near-complete separation of ore and gangue minerals as well as between ore minerals. Each processing step is designed to increase the grade (concentration) of the valuable components of the original ore.

## 「chrome mineral production line」
The production line of mining production line covers feeder, crusher, vibrating screen, jigging machine, conveyor, and so on. Beneficiation theory of chrome ore: After crushing by the crushers, chrome grains are liberated or dissociated from the gangue and the mixed ore can be fed to the separation processing for the secondary processing stages.

## Preventing Chromium Leaching 
In this case, high chromium leachability is desired and is aided by the addition of lime to a mixture of chromite ore and Na2CO3. The CaO-Na2CO3 ore mixture is roasted at 1,100 to 1,150 C in an oxidizing air
