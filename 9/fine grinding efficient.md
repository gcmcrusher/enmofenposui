This high efficiency air classifier was developed for ultra-fine, sharp separation, and is often used in conjunction with grinding plants. The optimized classifier wheel geometry produces the finest cut points and high yields that have not been possible with production scale conventional air classifiers with only one classifier wheel.

## Plane and Fine grinding of Metals and Other Materials 
Grinding papers are traditionally used for plane and fine grinding of all types of materials. Our Rhaco Grit is either based on Al 2 O 3 in the coarser grit sizes for high removal and long lifetime when grinding harder materials, or on SiC in the finer grit sizes for grinding of softer, more ductile materials. Grinding Stones are used for plane
