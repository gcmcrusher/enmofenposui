## Go through the mill 
The drum of a mill rotates at 60‚Äì95 percent of the "critical speed of rotation" (n cr = 42.3/ rpm, where D is the inside diameter of the drum in meters). When the critical speed of rotation is significantly exceeded, the grinding bodies are pressed to the side of the drum by centrifugal force, and grinding ceases.

## Critical Speed 
Critical speed is the first resonant frequency (speed) of the rotating shaft. Resonance in a rotating shaft can be catastrophic and even break the shaft. However, not all ball screws will necessarily exhibit such behavior since the nut represents another support of the shaft, permanently changing the unsupported length of the shaft and its

Oct 16, 2012Blade Tip Speed the velocity of the outer edge of the impeller. Disperser manufacturers target between 4000 and 6000 fpm (feet per minute) for the tip speed of their dispersers. When the speed of the disperser (rpm) is known, the blade diameter can be measured. With this information, the Tip Speed of the disperser blade can be calculated using
