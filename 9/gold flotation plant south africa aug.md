In the late 1970s and early 1980s there were approximately 25 pyrite flotation plants operating in South Africa. These were located in the gold mining areas where the slimes dams were retreated mainly to produce a concentrate for sulphuric acid production. The gold content was 0.5g/ton of which about 50% was recovered in the concentrate. Get Price
