35% marble dust. I'd normally use about 25% Portland for statuary and casting, but because you're using marble dust, increase the Portland ratio just a bit. The reasoning behind this is because by using smaller particles, the total surface area of the aggregates has been increased. You may also find the mix takes a bit more water than planned.
