1). Multi-layer processing method. When there are multiple cavities to be processed on aluminum alloy plate parts, if one cavity is processed in sequence, the cavity wall is easily twisted and deformed due to uneven force. The best solution is to adopt the layered multiple processing methods. That is, all cavities are processed at the same time.

## Why is the workpiece deformed during machining?
In machining process, the tool and the workpiece friction will generate heat, the heat will cause the workpiece deformation, therefore, often choose high-speed cutting. In this process, cutting chips in a short period of time, most of the cutting heat will be taken away by the chips, thus it can reduce the thermal deformation effectively.

## machine tool 
machine tool, any stationary power-driven machine that is used to shape or form parts made of metal or other materials. The shaping is accomplished in four general ways: (1) by cutting excess material in the form of chips from the part; (2) by shearing the material; (3) by squeezing metallic parts to the desired shape; and (4) by applying electricity, ultrasound, or corrosive chemicals

## Accurate compensation system for thermal deformation of machine tools
1. Summary Due to higher efficiency and higher accuracy for the machine tools, minimization of the thermal deformation, which causes to the machining dimensional deviation is required strongly. The thermal deformation is mainly caused by three factors. First, internal heat creation by machine operation, such as motor and main spindle running.
