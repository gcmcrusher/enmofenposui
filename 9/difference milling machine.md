## What is the difference between a lathe and a milling machine?
1. Different processing methods. Lathe: A machine tool that mainly uses a turning tool to turn a rotating workpiece. Drills, reamers, reamers, taps, dies and knurling tools can also be used on the lathe for corresponding processing. Milling machine: mainly use milling cutters to process various surfaces of the workpiece.

## Different types of CNC milling machines â€¢ 3axis Group
A milling machine is a machine that roughs, cuts and/or drills different solid materials, usually metal. This is done through chip removal by means of the high-speed rotation of the milling cutter and the movement of the axes, either of the element or of the mechanism. Most machines operate on three to five axes, creating much more precision and detail.
