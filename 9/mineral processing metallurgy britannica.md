## Mineral Processing and Recycling 
The Research Group for Mineral Processing and Recycling is led by Prof. Rodrigo Serna. Our approach is to study the underlying phenomena responsible of the performance of mineral processing operations. Of particular interest is the study of the interfacial phenomena occurring during mineral enrichment, in order to gain a practical understanding

## National Diploma in Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy 
Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy is the practice of removing valuable metals from an ore and refining the extracted raw metals into a purer form. In order to convert a metal oxide or sulphide to a purer metal, the ore must be reduced physically, chemically, or electrolytically.

## Metallurgical/Mineral Processing Engineering Masters
Mineral Processing Engineering deals with the extraction, separation, and concentration of minerals from raw ores. Extractive Metallurgy focuses on refining processes, such as pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and electrometallurgy, through which concentrates are refined into a pure metal form.

The ore lumps from the mines have the lump size of 10 100 cm while the individual minerals have grain sizes below 01 mm Hence the first step in any ore dressing plant is to aim at liberation by size reduction or comminution Comminution of any ore is carried out in several stages using different crushing equipments.

## Mineral processing news and technology • BulkInside
This process is called 'comminution' or 'size reduction.'. Comminution may be carried out on either dry materials or slurries. Most mineral processing operations are conducted with water as the medium; this is called wet processing against dry processing. Crushing, grinding, milling, and vibration (feeding) are examples of comminution processes.
