## Aggregate Crushing Value – Significance Test Procedure
Test Procedure. The aggregates crushing value test should be performed as per IS code 2386 Part IV. First, fill the sample aggregate with one-third of the cylindrical measure in three layers. Each layer should be tamped 25times freely. After filling the sample aggregate, weigh and record it as W1. Now fill the aggregate in the mould along with

The grading of the fine aggregate was then as BS 882:1973 which defined the grading for four zones of fine aggregate as shown in Table 19.5. Although BS 882:1973 has now been revised, Tables 19.319.5 are still of practical use as a guide to determining the ratio of fine to coarse aggregate required to make a dense mix.

## Sieve Analysis of Aggregates 
Sieve analysis helps to determine the particle size distribution of the coarse and fine aggregates.This is done by sieving the aggregates as per IS: 2386 (Part I) – 1963. In this we use different sieves as standardized by the IS code and then pass aggregates through them and thus collect different sized particles left over different sieves.

Recycled coarse aggregate The reused coarse aggregate was produced by crushing waste blocks which brought from Sohar city. Dry bulk density is 1430 kg/m 3, and the water content is 1.339% for recycled block aggregate (RBA) with a maximum size of 10 mm. The sieve analysis of RBA falls within the limits of BS 882 boundaries, which is shown in Fig. 3.
