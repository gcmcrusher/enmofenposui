Carbon steel is a form of steel containing carbon as a major constituent. Black steel is non-galvanized and has dark-coloured iron oxide coating on the surface. Has carbon content up to 2.1% by weight. Contains no carbon. The hardness of carbon steel depends on the carbon content. The black steel has high strength and hardness.

Carbon black (CB) is a form of nearly pure, elemental carbon. It differs in molecular structure from the more common forms of elemental carbon – graphite and diamond – and therefore also differs in physical properties. Carbon black is softer than either graphite or diamond and is intensely black in color, although the color does vary slightly
