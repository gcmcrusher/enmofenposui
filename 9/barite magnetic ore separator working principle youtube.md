## A Guide to Magnetic Separation 
A magnetic separator applies basic magnetic principles to remove ferrous based and paramagnetic metals from a range of substances including powders, granules, liquids, pellets or pastes. They are usually installed within the product stream at key HACCP or inspection points. See our guide to selecting the right Magnetic Separator.

## Different types of separation methods for minerals
This separation can be done either physically, via gravity separation, electrostatic separation and magnetic separation, or chemically, using froth flotation, leaching, and electro winning. Unusable minerals, which are often discarded into dams, are called tailing. In order to understand the benefits of dry mineral processing, you must first

Gravity separation has been applied to process chrome slag by steel researchers in India. Heavy media separation (Choudhury et al., 1996) and crushing and jigging (Khan et al., 2001) are the principal techniques used. The slag is subjected to 2-stage crushing to reduce the size to −10 mm and then screened into −10 +1 mm and −1 mm fractions.

Magnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using a magnet to attract magnetic substances. The process that is used for magnetic separation separates non-magnetic substances from those which are magnetic. This technique is useful for the select few minerals which are ferromagnetic (iron-, nickel-, and cobalt-containing minerals) and

## Introduction to Mineral Processing or Beneficiation 
12.01.2018In broader terms, mineral processing consists of two functions. Firstly, it involves the preparation and liberation, of the valuable minerals from waste minerals and secondly, the separation these values into two or more products, called concentrates. The term separation in this case is synonymous with concentration.
