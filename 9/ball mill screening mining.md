For the mining industry, our semi-autogenous (SAG) grinding mill uses a minimal ball charge in the range of 6-15 percent. It is primarily used in the gold, copper and platinum industries as well as in the lead, zinc, silver, and nickel industries. Autogenous (AG) grinding mills involve no grinding media as the ore itself acts as the grinding media.
