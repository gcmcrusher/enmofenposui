## HPGR High Pressure Grinding Rolls 
13.07.2016HPGR or high-pressure grinding rolls have made broad advances into nonferrous metal mining. The technology is now widely viewed as a primary milling alternative, and there arc a number of large installations commissioned in recent years. After these developments, an HPGR based circuit configuration would often be the base case for certain ore
