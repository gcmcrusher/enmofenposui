## Crusher 
AG mills crush the ore without the need for iron or steel grinding media. They are used when the ore is hard enough for the tumbling ore to grind itself. In SAG milling, ∼0.15 m 3 of 13 cm diameter iron or steel balls are added into the mill per 0.85 m 3 of ore (i.e., 15 vol.% "steel") to assist grinding. SAG mills are much more common.
