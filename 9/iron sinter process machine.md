## and how sinter of iron ore are made
27.10.2021Sintered Iron Ore/ Sintered Ore (SO) is the result of the sintering process. The product is made of ferrous and calcium which can be produced from fine iron ore and limestone thru a sintering machine. This mixture is then burned in a sinter machine to form hard but permeable lumps called sintered iron ore. The sintered iron ore is then fed to a

## Sinter Plant 
Sinter Plant. For Perantech, sintering technology is essentially a heat-based agglomeration process for fine iron ores. A sintering plant consists of a series of sequential operating units, with the sintering machine being the central element. This in turn is composed of individual machines such as screens, mixing drums, ignition furnace
