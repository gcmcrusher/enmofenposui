Flotation is a common mineral processing method used to upgrade copper sulfide ores; in this method, copper sulfide mineral particles are concentrated in froth, and associated gangue minerals are separated as tailings. However, a significant amount of copper is lost into tailings during the processing; therefore, tailings can be considered secondary resources or future

The gradual decrease of global copper resources is among the most urgent challenges for the mining industry. Sustainable utilization of copper sulphide flotation concentrate from iron oxide copper gold (IOCG) deposits is often constrained by the impurity elements (e.g. U, Th and F) and high levels of gangue minerals (e.g. iron oxide/hematite, U-bearing minerals and fluorite).

But even though the copper was moved to the Rydholms' hometown, it was not there permanently – in 2016, the world's largest piece of float copper was sold to Bryan Lees of Collectors Edge Minerals, Inc. A new piece of float copper weighing more than 400 pounds was installed at Presque Isle along with a plaque in memory of Mr. Rydholm in 2017.

Commercial copper production was declared on March 1, 2009, when copper concentrate inventory levels surpassed the 5,000 tonne shipping threshold. Increased zinc levels in the ore body, as it was continuously being mined, prompted the construction of a Cu/Zn separation circuit as extension of the previous flotation circuit.

## Effect of reagent chemistry on flotation of mixed copper ore
From past reviews, the recovery of copper from sulphide mineral using xanthate and pine oil is relatively easy, but mixed oxide-sulphide minerals do not respond to traditional sulphide collector. There is no common reagent to recover copper from both oxide and sulphide mineral, which is a great challenge in flotation of both the minerals simultaneously.

## The Challenges and Prospects of Recovering Fine Copper Sulfides 
Flotation is a common mineral processing method used to upgrade copper sulfide ores; in this method, copper sulfide mineral particles are concentrated in froth, and associated gangue minerals are separated as tailings. However, a significant amount of copper is lost into tailings during the processing; therefore, tailings can be considered secondary resources or future

## Estimated Water Requirements for the Conventional Flotation of Copper 
This report provides a perspective on the amount of water used by a conventional copper flotation plant, including the makeup water required to compensate for water losses. Much of the global supply of copper originates from mines that also produce byproduct molybdenum, but for simplicity, a single copper concentrate has been modeled for this
