## Quarry 
Stone quarry is an outdated term for mining construction rocks (limestone, marble, granite, sandstone, etc.). There are open types (called quarries, or open-pit mines) and closed types ( mines and caves). For thousands of years, only hand tools have been used in quarries. In the 18th century, the use of drilling and blasting operations was

Limestone quarries, the dark rectangular shapes just west of the urban areas, provide about half of the rock used in Florida's construction. In this part of Florida, groundwater is very near the surface. So as the rock is mined, the quarry pits fill with water. These lakes range from 30 to 50 feet deep and cover a total of about 4,900 acres.

## How Is Limestone Mined 
How Is Limestone Mined? Most limestone and dolomite are mined from open quarries although in many areas economic and environmental considerations favor large-scale production by underground mining. Underground Limestone Mining: The basic operations in underground mining are drilling blasting loading and hauling scaling and roof bolting.

## Limestone Mining Process 
It has abundant limestone reserves in China, but the mining and utilization situation is uneven. The current problems are: 1. Low resource utilization. At present, the utilization rate of limestone mines that are officially mined has reached more than 90%, while the utilization rate of civilian mining resources is only 40%.
