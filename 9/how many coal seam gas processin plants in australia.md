Oil. Oil is a liquid hydrocarbon formed deep underground from the decomposition of sea organisms such as plankton and algae. Over millions of years, heat and pressure from the changing geology transform this organic matter into oil and gas. The most common name for this is crude oil.

Underground coal gasification (or in-situ coal gasification) is a controversial mining process where coal is burned under the ground to create gas. Fuels are injected into the ground to ignite the coal to a temperature of degrees celsius in order to produce gas. The gas is then extracted out through vertical wells or in-seam boreholes.

## Fact Sheet 
Australia's Cooper Basin is in decline. Secondly, coal seam gas is plentiful in the coal seams of Queensland and New South Wales, so it's much closer to east coast markets than alternative gas supplies like the Western Australia Northwest Shelf. Coal seam gas is an energy source. Coal seam gas is natural gas found in coal seams deep below

## Coal seam gas — dirtier than coal, worse than shale 
In the land of desperate excuses, coal seam gas is king. The new boom industry of the Queensland and New South Wales hinterlands contaminates ground and surface waters, while taking rich farmland out of food production. But at least, its promoters argue, coal seam gas (CSG) is a weak hitter among sources of greenhouse pollution. When burnt in modern power

## High Point Vents in Coal Seam Gas Production 
In CSG production, the water and gas produced from coal seams are separated at the well head and pumped along dedicated gathering lines (dual pipelines). The gas is piped to a gas processing facility for compression, and the water is piped to water storage and treatment plants. Sometimes, very small amounts of gas enter the water gathering line.

The Surat Basin, Queensland, Australia, is a hot-spot of methane emissions for Australia. Within the Surat Basin there are over 6000 coal seam gas wells with extensive supporting pipeline networks and processing plants.

## Managing coal seam gas activities 
Commercial production of coal seam gas in Australia began in 1996 in the Bowen Basin of Queensland. Growth in coal seam gas activities has grown rapidly since then to 11,444 coal seam gas wells in Queensland at the end of the 2018–19 financial year.
