## Crushed Stone vs. Pea Gravel: What's the Difference? 
Crushed stone is available in a variety of sizes, from 3/8" to 4". Because it is literally crushed stone, there is no consistency to its shape. The edges tend to be sharper and it feels rougher to the touch than pea gravel. Also, most crushed stone will either be in a white or gray hue, giving you a more neutral look than the colorful pea

29.05.2020Paver thickness is generally about 3- to 3 1/2-inches.

## Geotextile Fabric for gravel driveway? 
28.03.2010A 12' width would be fine. The quarry/gravel pit owner says his trucks dump to a 12' width for the most part and that the 8' blade on our dozer will work good for blading the material out to 12' width. I'm also wondering if the fabric can be left exposed for a week or two before the gravel is brought in.
