My vintage 1970's Mill Mix. I just mixed up a 8lb batch of 50% wheat bread (white wheat). It had no problem mixing the dough and I don't believe I've even began to test the limits of the mixer, I think the bowl could easily handle a 16lb batch of dough. After 10 minutes of mixing the dough began to clear the sides of the bowl and passed the window pane test.

## Stone Milling Idioms (We Say Them All the Time!)
02/01/2019Grist for one's mill ~ Since wheat and corn are ground by 'teeth,' the grinding stones 'chew' the grist into flour; thus to 'chew' over something became a thought or idea to ponder. The daily grind ~ The repetitive nature of milling led to the concept of 'the daily (same old) grind.' Run of the mill ~ The ordinary, daily grind.
