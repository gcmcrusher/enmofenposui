Where Opal is today in Australia. Since the 1970's, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mining machines. These days, most if not all prospecting shafts are made by using a Calweld-type drill which is used to excavate holes about one metre in diameter using an auger bucket. The drills can dig to a maximum depth of about 28m to 30m.
