1. Raymond mill is better than ball mill in its grinding range, Raymond machine is almost applicable for all the material that ball mill is for. With higher output, lower energy consumption and better environmental protection, its finished product fineness is also better than ball mill. 2. Raymond mill occupies smaller area compared with ball mill.
