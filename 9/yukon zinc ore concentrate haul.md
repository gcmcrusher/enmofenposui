Zinc is found in the earth's crust primarily as zinc sulfide (ZnS). Rarely is the ore, as mined, rich enough to be used directly by smelters; it needs to be concentrated. Zinc ores contain 5-15% zinc. To concentrate the ore, it is first crushed and then ground to enable optimal separation from the other minerals.
