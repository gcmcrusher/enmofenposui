## How Is Iron Ore Extracted 
Feb 03, 2022How Is Iron Ore Extracted? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

## iron ore pellet furnace reactions
Shaft furnaces use pellets (produced in the same way as pellets for the BF), or lump ore. Raw material for pellets is produced by crushing and grinding low-grade iron ores—typically of the taconite class and finer than 325 mesh (0.044 mm)—and magnetically separating the iron oxide (magnetite, Fe 3 O 4 ) from the siliceous gangue.
