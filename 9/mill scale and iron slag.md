01/05/2022Mill scale is a uniform layer of various iron oxides and other impurities that covers hot-rolled steel surfaces. When machinery rolls the hot steel to form it, the air's oxygen reacts with the hot iron and creates these oxides. Mill scale has a black or black-blueish color and spreads evenly over the entire metal's surface.
