## 3 Phase Wiring for Dummies 
A three-phase motor must be wired based on the diagram on the faceplate. The first step is to figure out the voltage of your phases. In the United States, for low voltage motors (below 600v), you can expect either 230v or 460v. That being said, there is a wide range of different motors and what you have on hand can be completely different.

## How Does A Wind Turbine Inverter Work? – Solar Website
A solar panel is a conversion device. It converts the sun's energy or radiation into electrons which flow together as an electric circuit. A wind turbine produces electricity in a very different way by using a rotating generator consisting of magnets and copper windings. Small wind turbines are very similar in operation to a car alternator.
