A. Gupta, D.S. Yan, in Mineral Processing Design and Operation, 2006 6.1.3 Roll Crusher Circuit Design. Roll crushers are generally not used as primary crushers for hard ores. Even for softer ores, like chalcocite and chalcopyrite they have been used as secondary crushers. Choke feeding is not advisable as it tends to produce particles of irregular size.

simply poured into the hopper, where the lumps come to a crusher. From here, these move to the downstream gra ter, where the product is processed into a uniform, fine -grained, free -flowing product. The end fineness can be controlled by the size of the grater holes. The closed system ensures dust -free processing.

## The Process of Manufacturing Aggregate 
After the natural materials are gathered, the aggregate is processed, screened and washed to remove any unwanted coatings or chemicals. When processing, aggregates are fed through a primary crusher which will reduce the size of the concrete into chunks. After inspection for large usable products, the remaining materials from the primary machine

## Crusher, Crushing plant 
A crusher is a machine that uses mechanical energy to break blocks of stone, concrete, or other building materials into smaller blocks of a specific grain size. They are particularly used in the mining industry to reduce the size of ore blocks and facilitate their processing. Crushers are designed to receive blocks of a maximum size.
