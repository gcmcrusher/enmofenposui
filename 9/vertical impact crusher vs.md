They're also extremely suitable for secondary applications where material is fed by a primary crusher and reduced to a finer product. Powerscreen's impactor range is ideal for shaping applications including making chips, sand, concrete manufacture, and glass recycling. The range includes both horizontal and vertical impact crushers.

01.10.2003The impact crushers usually operate at very high rotational speed (1000 rpm for the vertical shaft crusher and 3000 rpm for the horizontal shaft hammer mill in this study). Dynamic motion of particles inside the crushing chamber and the interaction between the crushing element and the particles exerts a dominant influence on product size distribution.
