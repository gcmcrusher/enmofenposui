## How Is Gold Processed? 
29.03.2020Gold is processed by cyanide milling, a chemical procedure that separates 95 to 98 percent of the gold from raw mined ore. It is then refined to the gold standard purity, according to Mineweb. Heap leaching is a less expensive method of gold extraction, but it is a longer process and it recovers less gold than the cyanide milling process.

## Recovery of Gold and Silver from Ores by Hydrometallurgical Processing 
05.12.2006In 1952, technology was developed to strip gold from granular activated carbon and allow the carbon to be reused. In 1969, the heap leaching concept was applied to low-grade gold and silver ores and mine wastes. Heap leaching in conjunction with carbon adsorption-desorption permits very low value material to be economically processed.

## Ore Processing 
Ore processing consists of the following stages: Crushing and grinding of the ore. Addition of process water (generally decanted from the tailings pond) to form a slurry. Addition of lime to the ore, and cyanide solution to the slurry, to leach the gold and silver into solution. Addition of carbon to adsorb (attach) dissolved metals and remove

The comminution process is carried out in stages depending on the size of the ore to be processed, by using: Refractory ore processing, the ore is heated at a temperature of 0 C, usually about 10 hours in accordance with moisture. This process also reduces sulfur oxides in the rocks. Crushing is a process of destruction of ore from
