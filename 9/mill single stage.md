## Design and PLC Implementation of Complex Industrial Control Strategies 
A steel rolling mill produces a sheet of uniform thickness from a slab of steel. It typically consists of several rolling stages, with rollers in each stage compressing the sheet of steel passing through it (Figure 1). In between the roller stages, looper stages maintain the tension in the sheet and prevent tearing and formation of slack.

## Sugar Production 
Depending on the capacity of the sugar factory (typically 4000 to 12 000 tons of beet processed daily), some 50 to 100 centrifugal pumps, mostly single-stage, are employed; typically they run at four pole speeds (1500 or 1800 rpm). For media containing abrasive matter, pumps made of wear-resistant materials are used.
