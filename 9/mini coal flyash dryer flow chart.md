This level of performance was achieved while burning coal with an average sulfur content of about 2.0 percent on a dry basis. System guarantees called for 70 percent SOa removal for 1 percent sulfur coal and 87 percent SO2 removal for 2 percent sulfur coal. Compared with these goals, the demonstrated S02 removal was low.

## Desiccant Dryers 
Heatless desiccant dryers consume about 15 to 20 percent of their rating in purge air. This means 15 to 20 cfm of purge per 100 cfm dryer rating. If the compressed air is generated at an average specific power of 20 kW per 100 cfm at the compressor, the cost of the purge air is about 3 to 4 kW per 100 cfm of dryer nameplate rating.
