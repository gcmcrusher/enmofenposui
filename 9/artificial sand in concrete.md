## Why spread sand on artificial grass?
The sand provides stability and protects the turf. As a result, no wrinkles or folds develop through use. The sand also surrounds the long blades of artificial grass and ensures that they remain erect. An additional benefit of filling with sand is that it helps make the grass more fire resistant, for example in case the barbecue is knocked over

Both concrete made using artificial sand and natural sand are moderate to chloride permeability. In water absorption test we observed after 24 hours curing, the increase in weight of both natural sand and artificial sand blocks are less than 3% that means both concrete are low absorber hence concretes are good quality.

The use of artificial sand will conserve the natural resources for sustainable development of the concrete in construction industry [3]. Artificial sand is a process controlled crushed fine aggregate produced from quarried stone by crushing or grinding and classification to obtain a controlled gradation product that completely passes the 4.75mm sieve.

Artificial Turf. Artificial turf is a petroleum-based product promoted as a water- and maintenance- free alternative to conventional turf lawns. Before artificial turf is laid down, the soil below it is compacted. Then, a layer of sand or decomposed granite (or sometimes concrete) is put on top of the soil and compacted so the turf lays flat.

20/08/2016Artificial Sand - A Viable Alternative, An Alternate to River Sand in Concrete and Construction Industry. The artificial sand produced by proper machines can be a better substitute to river sand. The sand should be sharp, clean and course. The grains should be of durable material. The grain sizes must be such that it should give minimum voids.

## What is Concrete? Composition Types of Concrete 
Concrete, an artificial stone-like mass, is the composite material that is created by mixing binding material (cement or lime) along with the aggregate ( sand, gravel, stone, brick chips, etc.), water, admixtures, etc in specific proportions. The strength and quality are dependent on the mixing proportions. The formula for producing concrete
