Surface oil sands mining can be especially disruptive to the provision of ecosystem services. The extraction of bitumen from mined oil sands, and the direct distur-bance caused by land clearing and subsurface hydrolog-ical disruption, generate large quantities of process-affected materials inherent to resource-intensive extrac-tion.
