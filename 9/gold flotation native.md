## Gold Recovery 
Use of lime often results in the depression of native gold and gold-bearing sulRdes. The optimum Sotation pH ranges between 8.5 and 10.0. The type of frother also plays an important role in the Sotation of native gold and gold-bearing sulRdes. Glycol esters and cyclic alcohols (pine oil) can improve gold recovery signiRcantly.

flotation is to recover fast floating and liberated minerals in the grinding circuit and minimize the over-grinding of sulfide minerals. The first industrial attempt was made in 1982 in a copper mine in Finland. Due to the natural hydrophobic nature of gold (Yarar, Aksoy, 1989), flash flotation has been used for gold ores.

## Artisanal and Small
12.01.2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

## Gold extraction 
Gold occurs principally as a native metal, usually alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver (as electrum), or sometimes with mercury (as an amalgam).Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as color) embedded in rock minerals..

## Gold in Minerals and the Composition of Native Gold 
The native elements contain the most gold, followed by the sulfide minerals. Several gold tellurides are known, but no gold selenides have been reported, and only one sulfide, the telluride-sulfide mineral nagyagite, ii:; known. The nonmetallic minerals carry the least gold, and the light-colored minerals generally contain less gold

## Beneficiation of the gold bearing ore by gravity and flotation
Gold concentration usually consists of gravity separation, flotation, cyanidation, or the combination of these processes. The choice among these processes depends on the mineralogical characterization and gold content of the ore.

26.04.2021About 300,000 heavily-armed settlers descended to California to hunt for gold. This set the stage for the violence of genocide, said Benjamin Madley, an Associated Professor of Native American history at UCLA and author of An American Genocide. Large ranches recruited hundreds of Native men and sent them up to work in the mines.

## Natural hydrophobicity of native gold flakes and their flotation 
ABSTRACT We report that native gold flakes are inherently hydrophobic and exhibit a critical surface tension of wetting value, γC = 40 dyne/cm. This property persists even if gold is heated to 700–800C to eliminate potential, combustible organic contaminants. We also report that xanthates of chain lengths C2 to C5 exhibit essentially the same power as flotation collectors.
