## Milling, What is it and how does it work? 
Milling is a Substractive machining process that uses many machine toolsets to efficiently precision-cut a variety of materials (such as metals, plastics, or wood) into a defined geometrical part. Milling machines rapidly produce end-use parts by adopting 3- or 5-axis processes. Metal parts offer greater finishing choices, while machined
