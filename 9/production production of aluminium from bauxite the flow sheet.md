## Mining and Refining 
Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and/or saplings, for inclusion in a seedbank, which will form the basis of post-mining revegetation of the site. Next the top soil is removed and is usually also stored for replacement during rehabilitation.

## production of aluminium from bauxite
The next stage in the production chain is the processing of bauxite into alumina, or aluminium oxide - Al 2 O 3, - a white powder.The most common process for making alumina from bauxite is the Bayer process, which was first discovered over 100 years ago but is still in wide use today.

## How aluminium is produced
The aluminium production process can be broken down into three stages; first bauxites, which contain aluminium, are extracted from the ground. Second, bauxites are processed into alumina or aluminium oxide, and finally in stage three, pure aluminium is produced using electrolytic reduction, a process in which aluminium oxide is broken down into its components using

## Aluminium 
Primary aluminium production involves two key steps: alumina refining, to refine bauxite ore into alumina (aluminium oxide), and aluminium smelting, to convert alumina to pure aluminium. Average annual drops in alumina refining energy intensity for 2019 and 2020 were similar to those during (an average 3.0% per year).

## How aluminum foil is made 
Bauxite is heavy (generally, one ton of aluminum can be produced from four to six tons of the ore), so, to reduce Continuous casting is an alternative to melting and casting aluminum. An advantage of continuous casting is that it does not require an annealing (heat treatment) step prior to foil rolling, as does the melting and casting process.

## Production process 
Alumina production. Pure aluminium oxide, called alumina, is extracted from bauxite via a process called refining, composed of two steps: a digestion process, using caustic soda, which allows the separation of aluminium hydroxide from the so-called "bauxite residue", followed by a calcination step which removes the water content in the hydroxide.

## Aluminum, the Miracle Metal 
Between the production of aluminum from bauxite to well-known end products like buildings and beverage containers lies processing. The processing of aluminum—using castings, extrusions and mill products—allows the industry to support end users to become more innovative with their designs and utilize greater technologies.

Abstract A process for producing alumina from bauxite by the Bayer process. Bauxite slurry is pressure digested in caustic soda solution to dissolve aluminum hydroxides in the bauxite as sodium aluminate while leaving most of the remaining constituents of the bauxite in solid form as red mud. The red mud is separated from the digested slurry to obtain a caustic-aluminate
