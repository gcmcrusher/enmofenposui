The purpose of hollow grinding is to reduce the amount of steel that will then be abraded on waterstones. Harder and more abrasion-resistant steels, such as PM-V11, A2, and M2/M4, benefit this way. The reason I choose 30 degrees is that this is a good compromise for most steels for a cutting edge, and I then hone directly on the hollow.

Another advantage is hollow grind makes preparing food much easier and faster since it resists the sticking of food or any other sticky materials due to less friction. It also has less material supporting the edge and tends to lose the sharpness quickly, meaning it should be regularly maintained and re-sharpened.

A hollow grind will self-jig the blade so that it is supported on the sharpening medium. A hollow grind automatically created a microbevel, which reduces the area to hone, making sharpening faster.

## D2 planer blade Grinding hollow grind bevels on a knife blade
27.02.2017I seen quute a bit of videos on it. Well, one of the reasons I ordered the T7 is to make hollow grinds on 1.5 inch long neck knives. I'm not sure if the jigs that come with it would work though, or if I got to do it freehand. The D2 steel is ready to use planer blades one inch tall, one-eight thick and will be 4 to 6 inches long.

## What is the ideal size of wheel for hollow grinding?
The most common size wheel I have seen over the years is a 10. Personally, when I do produce a blade with a hollow grind, I will most often use a 10 wheel, but because I demand that the grind be right, and not one of those aforementioned perversions, the size wheel is determined by the thickness and width (edge to spine) of the blade.
