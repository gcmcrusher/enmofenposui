## Ball Mills Or Vertical Roller Mills: Which Is Better For Cement Grinding?
Ball mills are factory made and transported to the plant site of the buyer while VRM is built on the site of the cement plant. This helps to reduce cost and complicated logistics issues. The equipment cost is, however, higher for a VRM than a ball mill. So these are the pros and cons of the two technologies and a cement manufacturing company

Vertical roller mills (VRMs) are the main alternative means of grinding the clinker and are increasingly being used. For a quick introduction to VRMs see, for example, this advertisement on Youtube for an FL Smidth VRM. As part of the grinding process, calcium sulfate is added as a set regulator, usually in the form of gypsum (CaSO 4.2H 2 O).
