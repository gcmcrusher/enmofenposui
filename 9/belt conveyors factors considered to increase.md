## Belt conveyor frame types and design considerations
02.03.2020The ordinary head is mainly used for small belt conveyor, the snub head frame increases the support for the snub pulley, and the double pulley head frame is used for large conveyor. The intermediate frame is divided into standard and non-standard ones, with standard length of 6000 mm and non-standard length of mm. Classified by structural shape:

## ConvEx Paper 
Today, conveyor belts running at speeds around 8 m/s are no exceptions. However, velocities over 10 m/s up to 20 m/s are technically (dynamically) feasible and may also be economically feasible. In this paper belt speeds between the 10 and 20 m/s are classified as high. Belt speeds below the 10 m/s are classified as low.

## How Do Conveyor Belts Work? 
Conveyor belts are a tried-and-true energy saver designed to increase efficiency. Let's take a look at how conveyor belts work and why they've stood the test of time. How a Conveyor Belt Works. A conveyor belt works by using two motorized pulleys that loop over a long stretch of thick, durable material.
