24.06.2020Vertical Milling Machine. A vertical milling machine is defined by the vertical orientation of its cutting tool. The cutting tool is placed on a vertical spindle that can be raised or lower. When lowered, it will press into the underlying workpiece, allowing it to remove material. When raised, the cutting tool will pull away from the workpiece.
