## Using Windmills to Deliver Water 
13.03.2018It is important to center a windmill directly over a well. Bending or flexing the pump rod will lead to extra friction and early failure of the moving parts. It is also important that the top of the tower be level. All windmills are meant to rotate on the tower axis facing into the wind. If the tower is not level, the windmill will turn

## Collecting windmill weights can fetch many dollars
By the 1930 and into the 1940s, electricity began replacing windmills in parts of the country. As a result, many weights were relegated to scrap heaps or simply discarded over time. Now, many sell for a few hundred dollars up to several thousand dollars each. It is important, although, to be mindful of fakes.
