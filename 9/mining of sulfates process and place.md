Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively,

## Lode vs. Place Mining 
The process of placer mining is the process that is used to find the gold that has been eroded from the lode. Very generally speaking, placer mining involves sifting through gravel to separate the pieces of gold. Placer mining can be done by a single prospector with a gold pan. The process of lode, or hard rock, mining, on the other hand, is

Those ores contain iron sulﬁdes that oxidize during mining dis-turbance when exposed to the oxygen in the atmosphere. Unfortunately, once the process of acid drainage starts, it is virtually impossible to stop the biogeochemical reactions.

Roasting is a process of heating a sulfide ore to a high temperature in the presence of air. It is a step in the processing of certain ores.More specifically, roasting is often a metallurgical process involving gas–solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s). Often before roasting, the ore has already been partially purified, e.g. by froth

## A New Process For Sulfate Removal From Industrial Waters
Process Description. The most common method for removing high concentrations of sulfate from water is through addition of hydrated lime (Ca (OH)2), which precipitates calcium sulfate: Na 2 SO 4 + Ca (OH) 2 = CaSO 4 + 2 NaOH Calcium sulfate, which hydrates to become the common mineral gypsum, has a solubility of approximately 2000 mg/L as sulfate.
