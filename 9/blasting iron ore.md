A blast furnace is a block that smelts ores, raw metals, iron and gold armor and tools, similar to a furnace. A blast furnace smelts items at a speed of one item every 100 game ticks (5 seconds) or twelve items per minute, which is twice as fast as a standard furnace. It also serves as an armorer's job site block. A blast furnace can be picked up by any pickaxe. If mined without a

blast furnace, a vertical shaft furnace that produces liquid metals by the reaction of a flow of air introduced under pressure into the bottom of the furnace with a mixture of metallic ore, coke, and flux fed into the top. Blast furnaces are used to produce pig iron from iron ore for subsequent processing into steel, and they are also employed in processing lead, copper, and other metals.

## Iron Ore Reduction 
Currently the dominating process for the iron-ore reduction is the blast furnace (BF) technology. These furnaces consist of a moving bed reactor with a counter-current flow of the solid reactants against a reducing gas. Not only are the energy costs relatively high for these blast furnaces the pollution problems can also be quite severe.

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Iron Ore 
31/12/2018Iron ores are rocks from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The principal iron ores contain hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4). Hematite is an iron oxide mineral. It is non-magnetic and has colour variations ranging from steel silver to reddish brown. These can be used directly in blast furnaces or in direct
