30.11.2012Ground oyster shell also does not react with Portland cement, and the workability of concrete is decreased when the fineness modulus decreases. The higher the replacement levels of ground shell oyster in sand, the higher the rate of the development of compressive strength, and the lower the elasticity modulus (Yang et al., 2005).

Hydraulic cylinders located under the bearing shoes enable the entire mill shell to be raised and positioned. This allows any unevenness in the foundation to be compensated for and makes it possible to replace individual sliding shoes. Shell-supported ball mills are becoming the mills of choice over those with trunnion bearings.

## Experimental Study on Partial Replacement of Cement with Coconut Shell 
The Coconut Shell ash is used for the partial replacement of cement. Further, use of coconut shell ash as a value added material as in the case of binary blended cement concrete, reduces the consumption of cement. Reduction of cement usage will reduce the production of cement which in turn cut the CO 2 emissions. The time
