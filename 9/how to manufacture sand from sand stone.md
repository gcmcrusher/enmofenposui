## Sand Production Prediction Model for Tight Sandstone Oil 
Tight oil is an important unconventional resource, and sand production is an inevitable challenge during the field development. In this paper, based on data from the Daqing oilfield in Songliao Basin, the sand production of the tight sandstone oil reservoir is studied from the perspective of seepage and in situ stress distribution. Based on the combination of the formation fluid

## Sand Extraction: 1. Introduction 
Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.
