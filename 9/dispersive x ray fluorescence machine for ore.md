## Energy Dispersive Fluorescent X
X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic wave, the same as light. The wavelength of visible light is 400 to 800nm, while the wavelength of x-ray is much shorter (higher energy), at 0.001nm to 10nm, and is known to have strong penetrating power. Fig. 1 shows the interactions between a material and X-ray, and various analysis methods that make use of
