## Boiler inspection Procedure requirement and Recommendations
May 30, 2018Fly-ash corrosion may occur when fly-ash and refractory are in contact. Fluxing occurs and produces a slag that may be fluid at boiler operating conditions. Metal oxides found in fuel oil are fluxing agents. The general effect of slagging is to decrease the thickness of the refractory and thereby reduce its insulation properties.

07/12/2007Class C and F fly ashes were used in this research project. Currently, more than 50% of the concrete placed in the U.S. contains fly ash. Dosage rates vary depending on the type of fly ash and its reactivity level. Typically, Class F fly ash is used at dosages of 15% to 25% by mass of cementitious material and Class C fly ash at 15% to 40%.
