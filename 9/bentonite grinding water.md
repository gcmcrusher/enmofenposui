## Use of Bentonite Slurry in Pile Foundation 
Bentonite is the name used for a range of clays that can swell and gel when mixed with water. Bentonite is naturally found in form of sodium montmorillonite which exhibits thixotropic properties i.e. when bentonite is mixed with water it form a gel under static conditions but when disturbed or when distressed it regains its fluidity.

## Which factors will affect the flour effect of bentonite mill
When the water content in the bentonite raw material is high, the adhesion phenomenon is easily detected when grinding with a bentonite mill. It not only affects the normal operation of the equipment, but also causes a large amount of finished powder to bonds in the airway, thereby reducing the amount of water powder of the bentonite mill, affecting the influent soil mill.
