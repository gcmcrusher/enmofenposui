## From mine to port 
The road from mine to steel is a long journey that begins with exploration, which involves testing the bedrock for mineral deposits. If exploration is successful, mining and processing can follow. Our main products from the mines are iron ore pellets and fines, which are transported by rail to our ports in Lule and Narvik and then shipped

04.04.2022Lateritic ores have high moisture content that requires drying the ores in kiln furnaces. These kiln furnaces produce nickel oxide from the lateritic ores. At this stage, electric furnaces heat the nickel oxide at temperatures between 2,480 and 2,930℉ and produce Class 1 nickel metal and nickel sulfate.

## History, Deposits, and Production of Zinc 
30.03.2020The Extraction of Zinc from Ores. The most important mineral for zinc production is the so-called zinc blende (ZnS). This means that apart from zinc, the concentrate contains about 20 % sulfur. Additionally, zinc concentrates always contain iron, lead, and silver in varying proportions, because these elements often occur together in the ores.

The below table shows the iron ore (in million Metric Tons) transported by sea each year from 2010 to 2015 and its % share in the total dry bulk trade. As we can see, the volume of iron ore trade reaches almost the 30% of the total dry bulk trade and therefore, dry bulk shipping's dependence from the iron ore is very high.
