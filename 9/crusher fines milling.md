## The Importance of Primary Crushing in Mill Feed Size Optimization
fines, minimising the % medium while maintaining adequate % coarse is the objective of mill feed size optimisation. Results Monitoring the mill feed size WipFrag results showed a remarkable correlation between the % fines and mill tonnage for all grinding lines. The effect of feed size on one of our autogenous mills is shown in Figure 3 page I-193.

## Jaw Crusher 
For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80–85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 1.7 = 78 cm.

When iron ore is mined or processed in a crusher, lots of fines are generated. Quantity of fines generation is a function of the quality of ore i.e. whether it is hard or soft. Iron ore fines are usually subject to beneficiation andor pelletisation thereby converting them back into hard rock-like shapes pellets with a proper tumbler index
