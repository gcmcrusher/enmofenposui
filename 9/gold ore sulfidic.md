Microscopic gold inclusions in sulfide minerals cannot typically be extracted by conventional cyanidation. The gold ore must be pretreated to oxidize sulfide minerals associated with gold and to remove other minerals and chemical compounds that interfere in the cyanidation leaching process. The recovery of gold from refractory sulfidic-carbonaceous ores after

11.11.2020The high demand for gold, together with the shortage of natural resources and high pollution potential of wastes generated during mining and ore processing activities led to search for alternative sources of gold. A possible source is represented by mine wastes resulting from the processing of polymetallic or sulfidic ores. The reprocessing of

## Comparative investigations on sulfidic gold ore processing: A 
Ore samples were collected from a gold mine in Mexico and two metallurgical composites were prepared for the study. Comp #1 contains 2.7 g/t of gold and 15.4 g/t of silver with 0.33% copper and 0.11% arsenic. The total sulfur was 5.7% and the sulfide sulfur was 5.6%. Gold and silver grade of Comp #2 was 1.2 g/t and 8.8 g/t, respectively.

For the first time, an ionic liquid, Cyphos IL 101, has been evaluated for the selective gold recovery from thiosulfate leachate of sulfidic gold ore by solvent extraction. The pregnant leach solution at pH 9.5 contained 2.4 mg/L gold, 55.85 mg/L copper, and 0.26 mg/L silver in thiosulfate medium. The speciation of different metals was studied and selective gold extraction over
