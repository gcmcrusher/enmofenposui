Perlite's important natural property is the ability to expand when rapidly heated at temperature of 800C-950C. The abrupt, controlled rise of the temperature when we heat perlite causes the formation of white minuscule glass bubbles. Perlite mets, expands and attain an extremely porous surface, increasing its volume by 10-14 times.

Perlite is a natural type of volcanic glass. Mined perlite is hyper-heated, causing it to "pop". This forms those familiar Styrofoam-looking bits you often see in your favorite plant's soil. The process is similar to how a heated popcorn kernel pops into a fluffy piece of popcorn. Essentially, perlite = volcanic popcorn.
