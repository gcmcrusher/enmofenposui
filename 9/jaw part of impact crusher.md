## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work 
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing
