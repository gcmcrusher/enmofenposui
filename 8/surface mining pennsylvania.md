## Effects of surface coal mining and land reclamation on soil properties 
. Introduction. Highly mechanized mining processes are widely used in surface mining because they generally provide an efficient approach for achieving high production (Shrestha and Lal, 2011).However, high production is also associated with large volumes of waste production (Ramani, 2012).During surface mining, the excavated materials from depths of 0

Surface Mining. Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to the surface; that is, where overstrain (surface material covering the valuable deposit) is relatively very less or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for heavy handling or tunneling.

Coal mining began in earnest in Pennsylvania in the 19 th century and continued through the 20 th century to meet the nation's growing demand for steel, fueling the industrial revolution and two World Wars. Up until the passage of the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, the lower-quality coal refuse was disregarded in large piles across Pennsylvania. Why
