## Testwork: Bond ball mill work index 
Bond models, SGI, Morrell Mi. The Bond ball mill work index is one of the most commonly used grindability tests in mining, and is often referred to as the Bond work index . The test is a 'locked-cycle' test where ground product is removed from test cycles and replaced by fresh feed. The test much achieve a steady-state before completion.

## High energy ball milling process for nanomaterial synthesis
In particular, mechanical attributed contamination by the milling tools (Fe or WC) as well as ambient gas (trace impurities such as O 2, N 2 in rare gases) can be problems for high-energy ball milling. However, using optimized milling speed and milling time may effectively reduce the contamination. Moreover, ductile materials can form a thin coating layer on the milling tools
