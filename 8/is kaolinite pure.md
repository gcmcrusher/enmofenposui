Kaolinite covered much larger area of pyrite surface than montmorillonite owing to the positive charge occurring at the exposed aluminum-oxygen octahedral sheet of kaolinite. Although illite has a similar 2:1 structure to montmorillonite, it showed little or no effect on pyrite flotation, which was attributed to its poor swelling nature.

Although the mineral kaolinite - Al 2 Si 2 O 5 OH 4 is a common component of coloured earth pigments such as e.g. red or yellow earths its use for a pure white colour occurs only rarely in the historical European painting.

The mineral kaolinite is an aluminum silicate and can be represented by the formula (OH),Si4A1,0,,. The formula is frequently written as A1203.2Si02.2H20, which, although perhaps easier to remember, implies the presence of water of hydration that does not occur in kaolinite. Pure kaolinite has the composition, expressed as oxides, 46.54% Si02,

## White Clay Or Kaolin: Side Effects, Toxicity, Benefits And Properties
Characteristics of white clay. White clay or kaolin is characterized by its great whiteness, and compared to other clays it is usually much finer, this is due to the washing process it goes through. Although it is very low in iron, it has a high content of aluminum silicate. It is a very pure clay and its texture makes it manageable for whatever use.

## Geotechnical Properties and Geochemical Composition of Kaolin 
Kaolin is commonly the product of weathering of naturally occurring hydrated aluminium silicates. In many uses, the term kaolin typically includes the raw clay and refined commercial products (Bloodworth et al., 1993). As a clay-rich rock, it is dominated by kaolinite, a clay mineral that is composed mainly of Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4

Description. A type of [[primary clay] formed by the weathering of aluminum silicates, such as feldspars and Nepheline.When pure, kaolin is a soft, white, absorbent powder composed primarily of the mineral Kaolinite, a hydrated aluminum silicate.Impurities, such as iron oxide, silica, and other minerals, can produce yellow, red, blue, gray, or brownish color clays.

07.04.2022The kaolin-forming clays are all hydrous aluminium silicates, essentially kaolinite [Al2(Si2O5)(OH)4], that are formed by the decomposition of other aluminous minerals, especially feldspars. Kaolin deposits can be nearly pure kaolinite or may contain impurities that affect the characteristics of the clay.
