## Chapter 8 Summary Notes 
Consider the reversible gas phase elementary reaction. The rate law for this gas phase reaction will follow an elementary rate law. Where K c is the concentration equilibrium constant. We know from Le Chaltlier's Law that if the reaction is exothermic, K c will decrease as the temperature is increased and the reaction will be shifted back to the left. If the reaction is endothermic and

## Reactors 
Another classification of reactions is based on the phase(s) involved. In this classification, a homogeneous reaction is defined as a reaction which occurs in one phase. On the other hand, a heterogeneous reaction requires the presence of two or more phases for the reaction to take place (regardless of where the reaction is occurring).

Phase 3: Mature milk. About 10-15 days after birth, you start making mature milk. Like each phase of breast milk, it has all the nutrients your baby needs. The amount of fat in mature milk changes as you feed your baby. Let your baby empty your first breast before switching to the other breast during a feeding.

## Heat Treating of Titanium and Titanium Alloys 
A change in the solution-treating temperature of α-β alloys alters the amounts of β phase and consequently changes the response to aging. To obtain high strength with adequate ductility, it is necessary to solution treat at a temperature high in the α-β field, normally 25 to 85C (50 to 150F) below the β transus of the alloy.
