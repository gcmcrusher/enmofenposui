Cement and pozzolan show different reaction processes and react at different ages. As is known, the pozzolanic reaction becomes apparent after 7-15 days since mixing occurred (2). Production of pozzolanic cements are made by two ways; Clinker and pozzolan are ground separately and mixing with after grinding and clinker is ground with pozzolan

## Frontiers 
The cement industry is an energy-intensive industry, and improving the energy efficiency of cement has become necessary to reduce its carbon footprint and to compete in the global market. Clinker production consumes more than 90% of the total energy used in the cement industry. Therefore, a reduction in the burning temperature of the cement clinker can reduce

It is concluded that the addition of 1% synthesized zinc oxide nanopowder into portland cement production improves the burnability of the cement raw mixture. A reduction of clinker temperature up to 1,300C, instead of the 1,450C–1,500C usually required, was achieved, thereby enabling a reduction in both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

Alternatively, keeping the cement quality unaltered, it is possible to reduce up to 4-6% of clinker with other constituents. In normal conditions the strength increases are in the range of 20-50% after one day and 5-15% after 28 days.

The percentage of C 3 S in concrete is responsible for the higher strength development upto 28 days, while C 2 S contributes to strength development after 28 days.
