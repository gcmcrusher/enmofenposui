Coal Pulverizer Pall. While selecting a pulverizer, the coal characteristics play an important role. The Hardgrove index, total moisture, input coal size, output fineness, and mill wear have direct impact on the mill output. The Hardgrove index of coal tells us about the ease with which it can be pulverized.
