The universal milling machine was invented by Joseph R Brown a member of the Brown and Sharpe company in 1861. A milling machine is a machine tool that removes metal as the work is fed against a rotating multipoint cutter. The cutter rotates at a high speed and because of the multiple cutting edges. it removes metal at a very fast rate.
