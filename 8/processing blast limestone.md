## Production ‚Äì EuLA: European Lime Association
Lime is made from indigenous limestone or chalk rock, one of the most abundant materials in the Earth's crust. Limestone and chalk are both sedimentary rocks and are chemically known as calcium carbonate. When crushed or ground, they are widely used as aggregates and building products. As a raw material, calcium carbonate can also be processed to form lime.
