## Mines, Minerals, and Green Energy: A Reality Check 
Averaged over a battery's life, each mile of driving an electric car "consumes" five pounds of earth. Using an internal combustion engine consumes about 0.2 pounds of liquids per mile. Oil, natural gas, and coal are needed to produce the concrete, steel, plastics, and purified minerals used to build green machines.

## Molybdenum Processing 
Ball or rod mills crush and grind the mined ore to fine particles that may be only microns (10-3 mm) in diameter, releasing molybdenite from the gangue (worthless rock). The grinding mills on the right reduce rocks the size of soccer balls to the size of gravel. Further ball milling reduces the material to the consistency of face powder.
