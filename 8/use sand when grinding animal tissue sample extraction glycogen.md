## Glycogen: structure and functions 
14.04.2013Fats, proteins and glycogen are energy stores that the body uses when needed. In animals, fats are second only to proteins as reserve of energy, although proteins are an energy store of last resort, such as during a prolonged fast. In a healthy adult subject, fat mass accounts for about 21% of the body weight in man and 26% in woman.

## Experiment
B. We think that grinding tissue will release the glycogen from it because the tissue is actually tough, and to liberate the glycogen, the tissue has to be ruptured and broken down nicely so that all the glycogen is available for extraction. Using sand will aid in the grinding process. C. We think that the 10% acetic acid will acidify the solution.

The actual process of grinding is relatively simple and involves adding an extraction buffer and the tissue to the homogenizer tube, then slowly pressing the pestle on to the sample with a twisting motion. The piston is raised and lowered while twisting to help turn the sample to expose all sides to grinding.

Abstract. For Western blotting and coimmunoprecipitation (coIP), protein samples must be extracted from tissues. The protocol described in this chapter has been used to extract clock proteins from mammalian tissues as diverse as liver, kidney, and brain. The extraction protocol is mild enough to be used for coIP as well as Western blotting.
