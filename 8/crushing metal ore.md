Crushed Iron Ore is created by crushing Iron Ore in one of three different crafting stations. The crafting stations come with different ratios, labor cost and time cost. The two lover crafting stations also have a byproduct of Crushed Sandstone. Crushed Iron Ore needs to be further refined to Iron Concentrate before it can be smelted into an Iron Bar.

## General principles of extraction of metals
these metals can be obtained by the thermal decomposition of their oxide ores. 4. The oxide of a metal which is above another metal in the Ellingham diagram can be reduced by the latter. Thus, Mg can reduce Cr 2 O 3; Al can reduce Fe 2 O 3. For such a reduction, the free-energy change [metal(m1) oxide + metal(m2) → metal(m1) + metal(m2)oxide
