## Diff between shell face mill 
Face mills are for facing, usually not a taking a very heavy cut. Shell mills are for milling where you have a need to and can hog off material. A shell mill can offer a depth of cut that you cannot achieve with a face mill. Example: You want to mill a 2 wide, 3/4 deep step along the edge of a piece of aluminum.

## What Is the Difference Between Salt Grinders and Salt Mills?
Differences. Salt mills are best if you want more control over the chopping process; they use more sophisticated mechanisms and produce higher quality results. Grinders, however, still achieve a finely ground salt, and these are useful for most household needs. 00:00 00:00.

The main difference between Drill / End Mill styles is the point geometry. They are defined by how the flutes are designed on the end of the tool, using geometry typically seen on either an end mill or a drill. While mill style tools follow the features of an end mill or chamfer mill, the drill style geometry uses an S-gash at the tip.
