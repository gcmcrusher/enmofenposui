2. The most important reform was emancipation of the serfs in 1861, but this presented a huge problem: Liberating the serfs risked the destruction of the basis of the entire regime. 3. The nobility as a land-owning class was vital to the monarchy, and to take away their serfs might ruin them economically. 4.

Although a few mined ores contain sufficient metal concentrations to require no beneficiation (e.g., some iron ores), most contain relatively small amounts of the valuable metal, from perhaps a few percent in the case of base metals to a few parts per million in the case of precious metals. As Chapters 7, 9, and 10 of this book have amply illustrated, the minerals containing valuable

## Ore 
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.
