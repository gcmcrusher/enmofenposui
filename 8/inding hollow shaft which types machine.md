With machining, cost per part increases with part complexity. Undercuts, pass throughs, and features on multiple part faces all contribute to increased part cost. Machining processes require allowances for tool access and certain geometries, like curved internal channels, are difficult or impossible to produce with conventional subtractive methods.

Design of Shaft A shaft is a rotating member usually of circular cross-section (solid or hollow), which transmits power and rotational motion. Machine elements such as gears, pulleys (sheaves), flywheels, clutches, and sprockets are mounted on the shaft and are used to transmit power from the driving device (motor or engine) through a machine.

For a key to function, there must a keyway on the shaft and a keyseat the rotating machine element. The key is then tightly fitted between the keyway and the keyseat, hence the mechanism is called a keyed joint.

17.09.2021A shaft coupling is one of the most common machine elements because it is just so important in power transmission systems.Thus, they find use in a variety of applications and service environments. As a result, designers and engineers have designed many variations of couplings for specific service conditions and environments over the years.

## Shaft/Hole Tolerances For Clearance Interference Fits
02.08.2016The first principle to grasp is the fit designation of the shaft /hole joint. The fit designation ranges from clearance fits to interference fits. This is an intuitive concept to grasp- a clearance fit specifies a fit where there will always be a gap in the joint between the mating shaft and hole. Even at the maximum shaft and minimum hole

13.04.2015Shaft size is dictated by torque, not horsepower. But changes in horsepower and speed (rpm) affect torque, as the following equation shows: Torque (lb-ft) = hp x 5,252/rpm. Accordingly, an increase in horsepower would require more torque, as would a decrease in rpm. For example, a 100 hp motor designed for 900 rpm would require twice as much
