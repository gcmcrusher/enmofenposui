## Fracturing and fluid‐flow during post‐rift subsidence in carbonates 
10.04.2017In this contribution, we present a model for the development of fracture networks in carbonate rocks during regional post-rift subsidence based on the analysis of well-suited outcrops. We show that syn-subsidence fracturing is important and led to the development of an extensive fracture network, opening pathways for regional flow which was eventually shut down by the
