## Vertical Roller Mill Development History 
The technology breakthrough of vertical mill started from the 1960s. From then, vertical mill got optimized and upsizing. After being used for grinding raw material in cement industry in Europe, America and Asia, vertical mill got rapid development in the 1970s. Large scaled vertical mill with capacity 500t/h even appeared at that time.

## Factors affect the operation and running of vertical roller mill
05.11.2021The grinding force of vertical roller mill comes from the dead weight of grinding roller and the pressure of hydraulic station, and the hydraulic tension device is the main source of grinding force. The working pressure of the grinding roller needs to be reasonably set according to the feed volume, material layer thickness, product fineness and other factors.
