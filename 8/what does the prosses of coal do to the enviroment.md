Nanofiltration is a pressure related process, which typically removes 50%-90% of monovalent ions. Nanofiltration is commonly used for the removal of pesticides or heavy materials from water, water softening, and nitrates removal. Nanofiltration is often employed in manufacturing processes for pharmaceuticals, dairy products, textiles and bakeries.

## What is coal used for? 
Certain types of bituminous coal can also be used in making steel. Coal used for steel making needs to be high in carbon content and low in moisture, ash, sulfur, and phosphorous content. Coal that meets these specifications is known as metallurgical coal. Coal also has a myriad of other uses, including in cement production, carbon fibers and

20.03.2013Coal can also increase the level of macronutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. Most nitrogen in coal is released only upon heating, but Ahrens and Morrisey point out that the issue has not been well studied. A 1996 study of Spanish coals found that "little phosphorus was mobilised by water.".

## What is coal used for? 
Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity. In 2019, about 23 percent of all electricity in the United States was

Coal is a sedimentary deposit composed predominantly of carbon that is readily combustible. Coal is black or brownish-black, and has a composition that (including inherent moisture) consists of more than 50 percent by weight and more than 70 percent by volume of carbonaceous material. It is formed from plant remains that have been compacted, hardened, chemically

## How does coke and coal play into steel making?
Jun 22, 2016Coke is used as a fuel and a reducing agent in melting iron ore. It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke, making it ideal for smelting iron and steel. Prior to the 1880's, steel was produced using charcoal.
