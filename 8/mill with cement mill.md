a Loesche mill, with a grinding track diameter of only 1.1 metres, was used as long ago as 1935. However, the breakthrough in grinding this type of material on the vertical roller mill did not take place until the beginning of the 1990's. 1935 The first Loesche mill for grinding cement clinker, an LM 11, was commissioned in Joao Pessao, Brazil.

Mill Feeders: Feeders will be directly installed under hoppers with rod gate in between. The feeders are generally 2 to 3 m long and discharge on to a common conveyor which will take feed to mill. Feeders for mills meter feed rates and also tantalize tons fed. For cement mill feeding, table feeders, belt feeders, and weigh feeders have been used.

Introduction of Cement Mill: Cement can be not only hardened in the air, but also better hardened in the water in which it will maintain and develop strength. So cement is kind of cementitious material which will be of stronger hardness in water. Cement mill is used for cement grinding. Cement crusher is applied for cement crushing.
