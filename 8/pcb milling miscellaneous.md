## Tool condition monitoring of PCB milling machine based on vibration 
01.01.2021The experimental results show that the spindle vibration can distinguish sharp and worn microtools with proper feature extraction. With the vibration signals from all the three speeds, the PCB milling done at 8000 rpm with 0.1 mm 20for engraving and 0.4 mm for drilling shows better results of tool wear monitoring.

## PCB milling Which bits to use for PCB milling?
03.09.2018Your two options are: - V-bits and pyramid bits off eBay - cheap but functional. - Specialized PCB bits (such as PreciseBits) - supposedly better than V-tips but $10 to $15 a piece. RPMs and feeds: depending on the machine and spindle you have. My sweet spot is 8 000 RPM and 150mm/min; yours can be totally different.

The type of CNC mill, the type of machine controller, and the age of the machine will affect the amount of information that can be input directly into the machine. Historically G-code was created externally from a CNC machine and then loaded onto the machine. Externally created G-code was authored either with a dedicated CAM software or with a plug-in embedded in the 3D

## PCB Isolation Milling 
07.07.2022I would like to create a toolpath to mill the traces of a PCB in a copper clad board. I was using KiCAD and FlatCAM for this, but it does not do rest machining, and I'm spending hours running extremely small endmills around the entire board when they are only needed for a couple small spots. So I bought a Fusion360 license assuming it could be integrated with Eagle to do

Before milling, run through this checklist to ensure we're properly setup. Check the right milling tool is selected and configured – 1/32 end mill. Check the right material profile is setup – Double-sided FR-1 Standard size. Check the placement is set to the left . Check each .brd part is milling only traces and NOT holes and outlines.

Step 4: Making the X-Axis Frame. Now for the X-Axis Frame. I have basically made the same kind of connection using corner blocks. These two pieces of extrusion in between provide the lateral support required. To make the fitting easy I have made sure the corner blocks are flush to the top.
