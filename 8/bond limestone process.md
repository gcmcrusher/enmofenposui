## Whiskey Process 
There's no pressure cooking at Limestone, just an old-fashioned open cook, starting at 200-degrees-plus to break down the starches of the corn. Many larger distilleries cook all the grain at one time, but we take a three-stage temperature cook. After the corn we lower the temperature, add our rye, and ultimately lower the temperature again to

## Limestone: Rock Uses, Formation, Composition, Pictures 
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.
