## what is a receiving feeder in a crusher 
Jan 01, 2016 A grizzly screen is placed between the magnet and the receiving hopper of the crusher to scalp (remove) boulders larger than the size of the gape. Some mines deliver product direct to storage bins or stockpiles, which then feed the crushers mechanically by apron feeders, Ross feeders or similar devices to regulate the feed rate to the crusher.

## Feeding the Crusher 
27.07.2020Always check that the crusher is on level ground with no cross fall or you will get uneven feed, cause uneven wear and potentially damage the crusher. If the crusher is setup on ground that is facing uphill, the feeder will have to work harder to move the material. Flat or a 1-2 degree downhill angle is acceptable. Striker JQ1060 Jaw Crusher.
