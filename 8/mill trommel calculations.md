## Combined DEM and SPH simulation of overflow ball mill 
A trommel is a rotary cylindrical structure that is rigidly attached to the discharge end of a mill. The intended operation of the trommel is shown schematically in Fig. 1. It contains moulded screen panels or wire mesh and can have different aperture configurations in each axial section depending on the intended duty.

## Trommel Screens 
The SAG mill trommel screen provides a simple mechanism to classify large volumes of mill product. Trommel Screens are attached to the end of grinding mills and scrubbers to perform a variety of screening functions. The trommel screen comprises the rubber lined steel frame and replaceable screening surface.

## Mill tolerance and Piping Stress Analysis 
Someone wrote around " According to my understanding, Mill Tolerance is the tolerance for variation in the thickness of pipe from nominal pipe thickness which is 12.5% according to B31.3 ". This is not correct. EN 13480, ASME B31.1 and B31.3 often address to pipe tolerance, but they normally don't define its value.
