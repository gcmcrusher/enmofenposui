## A new approach to load measurement for industrial scale ball mill 
Precise load measurement is important and difficult for an industrial scale ball mill in thermal power plant. This paper presents a new approach which combines a novel feature extraction method and a hierarchical model to achieve this purpose. By analyzing the sensitivity distributions of working condition transitions and removing the ineffective information, the characteristic

## Ball Mill 
Ball mills are classified as attritor, horizontal, planetary, high energy or shaker. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1–1.5 times the shell diameter. Ball mills are filled up to 40% with steel balls (with 30–80 mm diameter), which effectively grind

While ball mills save considerable time and effort over hand grinding with a mortar and pestle, this is not without cost. List prices for the simplest jar mills are in the ballpark of $3,000 USD, and 4-station mills like the one shown above can cost $10,000 or more. Grinding bowls with lids can be $1,000 to $2,000 each depending on the size and the material required. Balls can add

## Motor Sizing Basics Part 1: How to Calculate Load Torque
To calculate load torque, multiply the force (F) by the distance away from the rotational axis, which is the radius of the pulley (r) . If the mass of the load (blue box) is 20 Newtons, and the radius of the pulley is 5 cm away, then the required torque for the application is 20 N x 0.05 m = 1 Nm. Typically, a safety factor is used so that the

## Ball Screw Selection 
Ball Screws. The ball screw drive is an assembly that converts rotary motion to linear motion (or vice versa). It consists of a ball screw and a ball nut packaged as an assembly with recirculating balls. The interface between the ball screw and the nut is made by balls which roll in matching ball forms. With rolling elements, the ball screw
