Angle of Nip — The angle formed between the moving surface of a crusher roll or jaw plate and the stationary plate surface at which point the material will be pinched. Angle varies with machine size and material lump size. Bond Work Index (BWI) — Kilowatt hour (kWh) per short ton required to reduce the material to 80% passing 100 microns.
