This design allows for a motor with low inertia and high efficiency. Coreless motors can accelerate and decelerate much more rapidly than a traditional motor. Eliminating the iron rotor also reduces torque ripple or cogging. The motor operates smoothly, even at low speeds. The lack of iron in the rotor also reduces the total mass of the motor.

The ball bearing needs to be securely fitted on the motor. The rotor fixes the ball bearing on one side, and a suggestion of a part for locking the ball bearing on the other side was designed. The part is intended to cover the inner rim of the ball bearing, without interfering with the rotational movement of the rotor. 2.8 Experimental board

## Starting Methods of Synchronous Motor 
Synchronous Motor Starting with Damper Windings. At present, damper windings are most widely used method of starting a synchronous motor. A damper winding is made up of heavy copper bars inserted in slots cut into the pole faces of the rotor as shown in Figure-2. These copper bars are then short-circuited by end rings at both ends of the rotor.

A wound-rotor motor, also known as slip ring-rotor motor, is a type of induction motor where the rotor windings are connected through slip rings to external resistance. Adjusting the resistance allows control of the speed/torque characteristic of the motor.
