## Influence of endosperm texture on milling, chemical composition 
Three maize varieties namely Vijay, SO/SN composite and Shakti, which differ in their nutritional quality and endosperm texture were processed to prepare semolina (sooji) and process-flour. The nutritional quality of these products was determined and compared with whole kernel flour of the respective variety. Distinct differences in milling and chemical composition of three
