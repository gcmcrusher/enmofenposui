## What Makes a Great Wind Turbine for Distributed Applications?
A turbine's tip speed ratio is the optimal velocity of its blade relative to the wind speed. The higher the tip speed ratio, the thinner the blades can be and still produce optimal power. Designers of traditional HAWT's normally hone in on a tip speed ratio of about eight, which equates to blade speeds of 200 mph in a 25-mph wind.

Jun 14, 2021Pipes sometimes break after a while even when left alone, just because the ground settles unevenly. A bulk of concrete is known to settle in a different fashion (it sinks as a whole) and to break pipes even not directly in contact with it. 20-40cm separation is probably OK-ish, but aim for a meter (3ft) if possible.

DIY VAWT - Vertical Axis Wind Turbine. In this project, we will build a small DIY VAWT, Vertical Axis Wind Turbine. We are not expecting to get much over 50 watts of production, though it would be fairly simple to double the size of the blade area to increase power. This DIY VAWT is based on the use of 4 inch PVC pipes, cut in half, for the blades.
