Tanzania 1,200t/d Gold Mineral Processing Plant. The Tanzania 1,200t/d gold mineral processing plant was an EPC+M+O project. The ore consisted of sulfide (10.7g/t) and oxide (2.4g/t), with Au being the only valuable element. They achieved a leaching rate of 93.75% and 91.58% respectively through the all-slime cyanidation gold extraction process.

Mar 29, 2020 Gold is processed by cyanide milling, a chemical procedure that separates 95 to 98 percent of the gold from raw mined ore. It is then refined to the gold standard purity, according to Mineweb. Heap leaching is a less expensive method of gold extraction, but it is a longer process and it recovers less gold than the cyanide milling

## How Gold Is Mined 
Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity – known as dor – typically containing between 60-90% gold.
