There are two main methods of exploration drilling - core drilling and reverse circulation drilling (usually referred to as RC). Core drilling, yields a solid, cylinder shaped sample of the ground at an exact depth. Reverse circulation (RC) drilling, yields a crushed sample, comprising cuttings from a fairly well determined depth in the hole.
