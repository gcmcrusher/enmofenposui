## Managing conveyor belt carryback 
The U.S. Bureau of Mines states that an average of 100 g/m 2 of carryback is a reasonable level of performance for belt cleaning. At this level, a 1200 mm wide belt traveling 2 m/s and operating 24/7 would create a cleanup workload of about 7 tons per day, a significant labor investment that also increases worker exposure to a moving conveyor

## Shaped wire belt stands up to the rigors of heat treating
28.08.2021August 28, 2021. Aerospace manufacturers using heat treatment – which can reach temperatures up to 2,400F and vary from a few seconds to 60+ hours – need conveyor belting that can withstand the rigors of the process. However, traditional round balance weave wire belting has changed little in 100 years and often requires annual replacement
