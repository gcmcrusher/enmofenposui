## Ore Processing 
Ore processing consists of the following stages: Crushing and grinding of the ore. Addition of process water (generally decanted from the tailings pond) to form a slurry. Addition of lime to the ore, and cyanide solution to the slurry, to leach the gold and silver into solution. Addition of carbon to adsorb (attach) dissolved metals and remove

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below). These heaps

## How Is Gold Processed? 
29.03.2020Gold is processed by cyanide milling, a chemical procedure that separates 95 to 98 percent of the gold from raw mined ore. It is then refined to the gold standard purity, according to Mineweb. Heap leaching is a less expensive method of gold extraction, but it is a longer process and it recovers less gold than the cyanide milling process.
