## Milling Machines; What are They and What Do They Do? 
18.08.2020Milling machines are a type of machinery for removing material from a workpiece using rotary cutters. These machines can drill, bore, and cut an array of materials. This process of removing pieces of the material in line with the tool axis is known as milling, and thus the machines used in the process are called milling machines. Milling
