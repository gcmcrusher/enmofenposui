## Clamping Force Calculation 
R 1 = 1270 lbs. R 2 = 2790 lbs. In other words, the combined force from all clamps on the right side must be greater than 1290 lbs. We recommend a 2-to-1 safety factor (2580 lbs). Even though F L (the combined force from all clamps on the left side) equals zero, a small clamping force may be desirable to prevent vibration.
