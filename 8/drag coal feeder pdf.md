## Design and Review of Millmerran Coal Handling Plant 
A detailed review of the coal handling plant, conveyors and chutes was carried out. The solution was to connect the Reclaim conveyor to the Stacker conveyor system through a Re-blending conveyor system. By using this method the coal can be stacked in the emergency area until it is dry enough for handling.

## How to Design Efficient and Reliable Feeders for Bulk Solids
When a feeder stops, solids flow should cease. When a feeder is turned on, there should be a close correlation between its speed of operation and the rate of discharge of the bulk solid. Feeders differ from conveyors in that the latter are only capable of transporting material, not modulating the rate of flow. Dischargers are also not feeders.

## Case Study: Coal and Ash Handling 
North Dakota's abundant coal reserves made it an economical fuel that offers high heat content (BTU) per ton. The material handling system, engineered and manufactured by CDM, started with a truck receiving conveyor. The conveyor was designed to handle material flow rates of 55 TPH to ensure the plant never ran short on fuel.
