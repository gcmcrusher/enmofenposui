## [PDF] A quick method for Bond work index approximate value 
Nov 01, 2016The Bond work index is a measure of ore resistance to crushing and grinding and is determined using the Bond grindability test. Its value constitutes ore characteristic and is used for industrial comminution plants designing. Determining the Bond work index value is quite complicated, timeconsuming and requires trained operating personnel and therefore is
