6. Typical Milling Operations 6.1. Plain Milling Plain milling is the milling of a flat surface with the axis of the cutter parallel to the machining surface. It can be carried out either on a horizontal machine or a vertical machine as shown in figure 16. Figure 16. Plain Milling 6.2. End Milling

## 8 Main Types of Milling Cutters 
Type # 1. Plain Milling Cutter: It has straight or helical teeth cut on the periphery of a disc or a cylindrical surface. It may be of solid inserted blade or tipped type, and is usually profile sharpened but may be form relieved also. Generally helical teeth are used if the width of the cutter exceeds 15 mm.

Milling is the most common form of machining, a material removal process, which can create a variety of features on a part by cutting away the unwanted material. The milling process requires a milling machine, workpiece, fixture, and cutter. The workpiece is a piece of pre-shaped material that is secured to the fixture, which itself is attached

## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) 
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE 'S.O.P'. All stock must be properly secured in the lathe chuck or mounted prior to the machining process taking place. Use the correct sized clamp or vise for the stock being machined. Turn the chuck or faceplate by hand to ensure there is no binding or danger of the work striking any part of the lathe.
