## Distance Relay or Impedance Relay Working Principle Types
24.02.2012The working principle of distance relay or impedance relay is very simple. There is one voltage element from potential transformer and a current element fed from current transformer of the system. The deflecting torque is produced by secondary current of CT and restoring torque is produced by voltage of potential transformer.

02.06.2017Hammer mill Impact mills are similar in construction and principal to HSI and VSI crushers. Impact mills are used to pulverize feed material by impact against a surface or a bed of feed material. The feed material may be propelled by gravity or by a rotating impeller or rotor. The impellers or rotors can be vertically or horizontally orientated.
