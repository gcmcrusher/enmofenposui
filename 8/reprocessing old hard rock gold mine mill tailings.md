Four basic types of waste produced by hardrock mining are: Mine Water. Waste Rock. Spent Ore. Mill Tailings. Total waste (rock waste and mill tailings) produced during extraction and beneficiation of minerals can range from 10% of the total raw material removed from the earth for potash to more than 99.9% for gold.
