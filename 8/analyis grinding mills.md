## Surface Quality Analysis in Mill
Mill-grinding experiments were carried out on SiCp/Al to investigate effects of mill-grinding parameters and grinding wheel parameters on machined surface roughness in this paper. The machined surface topography was also analyzed. Experimental results show that surface roughness increases with increasing feed rate and the depth of the mill-grinding.

It has been emphasized that, as the purpose of grinding is to produce fine particles, the mill design and scale-up work should be based mainly on the F  parameters. Moreover, it is not correct to regard the S  values to be independent of the mill design and operating variables as a general rule, especially for a fine analysis of the
