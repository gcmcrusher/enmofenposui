The two mining methods used in coal extraction are surface "Open Pit" mining and Underground mining. Simply put, surface mining is peeling back the earth and collecting coal near the surface. Whereas, underground mining requires tunneling and building shafts. The mining method chosen by companies depends on the coal deposit being extracted.
