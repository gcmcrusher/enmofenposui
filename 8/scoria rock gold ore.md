## Eureka County Nevada Gold Production – Western Mining History
The highest grade ore occurs along a nearly vertical fault that disrupts country rock composed of basalt and interbedded scoria. Both sulfide and oxide ore are present. The oxide ore consists of kaolinized breccia with high gold and silver values; the sulfide ore is primarily fine grained pyrite in talc-rich rock (Vanderburg, 1938a, p. 19-21).

Pyrite was once used as a source of sulfur, but is now only a minor ore for both sulfur and iron. Pyrite from some localities is auriferous, and therefore is used as an ore of gold in gold-bearing localities.Pyrite was polished by the Native Americans in the early times and used as mirrors. Today, it is used as an ornamental stone, as well as a very popular stone for amateur collectors.

Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity – known as dor – typically containing between 60-90% gold.

## Extracting gold from rock 
30.08.2019When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.
