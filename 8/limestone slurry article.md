Whatever the final form, all three lime products start life as limestone. After being quarried and crushed, the limestone (CaCO 3) is heated in a kiln to drive off carbon dioxide – a process known as calcination. This leaves quicklime, or calcium oxide (CaO), a material that has been used by humans throughout history.

## A model for the absorption of sulphur dioxide into a limestone slurry 
A model has been developed for the removal of sulphur dioxide from flue gas by absorption into a limestone slurry. The flue gas desulphurization unit consists of an absorber tower and an oxidation tank. Flue gas enters the absorption tower at the bottom and meets the limestone slurry. There are five important chemical reactions with a finite rate.

## Limestone origins — Science Learning Hub
28.09.2012Limestone origins. Limestone is a very common sedimentary rock consisting of more than 50% calcium carbonate. Although it occurs in many different forms, its origins can be traced back to either chemical or biochemical processes that occurred in the geological past, often tens to hundreds of millions of years ago.

## Why Use Slurry Primer 
Slurry Primer use for non-porous (impermeable) paving slabs. A priming slurry must always be used when installing porcelain paving. It will also be necessary for all natural stone with low porosity (such as slate and most types of granite or igneous rocks). Porcelain paving is vitrified (like glass). It is ostensibly homogenous, and lacks the

## Flue gas desulphurisation system
The uncleaned flue gas is sprayed in a scrubber tower (absorber tower) with a mixture of water and limestone (scrubbing slurry), whereby most of the sulphur dioxide is bonded by chemical reaction. See Fig. 1 Flue gas desulphurisation system. After a number of chemical reactions, gypsum is finally produced in a suspension.

## Limestone Slurry for Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD)
Limestone scrubbing is the method of choice for coal-fired plants, yielding efficiencies of 90% - 98%. SO2 is neutralized by direct contact with limestone slurry in an absorption tower. Slurry is produced by crushing limestone in a ball mill and mixing it with water. During this slaking process, conversion to calcium hydroxide is achieved.
