01.09.2020In general, solid cone nozzles are more widely used in coal mine spraying equipment because of their large, atomizing coverage area. Some of the mechanical atomizing nozzles commonly used in coal mines, as listed in Table 1, were selected for the spraying experiment, during which the water pressure was set to 2, 4, 6 and 8 MPa.
