and alumina. Finished cement is produced by finely grinding together around 95% cement clinker with 5% gypsum (or anhydrite) which helps to retard the setting time of the cement. The quality of cement clinker is directly related to the chemistry of the raw materials used. Around 80–90% of raw material for the kiln feed is limestone.
