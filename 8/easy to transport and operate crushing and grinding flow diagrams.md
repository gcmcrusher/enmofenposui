## What is a biorefinery? 
Entrained flow gasifiers normally require dried material. It is not primarily the gasifier that sets the drying requirements, but the crushers, conveyors and gasifier charging systems that needs a dry fuel to maintain a continuous flow of biomass to the gasifier. The particles must be small, typically diameters below 0.1 mm for coal. However, since

## What is a Process Flow Diagram 
A Process Flow Diagram (PFD) is a type of flowchart that illustrates the relationships between major components at an industrial plant. It's most often used in chemical engineering and process engineering, though its concepts are sometimes applied to other processes as well. It's used to document a process, improve a process or model a new one.
