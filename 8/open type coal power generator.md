31.01.2020It was burned in fireplaces in ancient Rome and in Hopi ovens in what would eventually become the American Southwest. During the industrial revolution, coal was used to power large furnaces and steam engines, necessitating deeper and more dangerous coal mines. Coal production jumped from 10 million tons in 1800 to 250 million tons in 1900.

07.05.2020Long before Alberta's first oil and gas boom, the province relied on coal to heat homes, generate electricity, and provide fuel for transportation. Coal was also the first energy commodity to be exported from the province, starting in the late 1800s. By the 1960s, however, oil and natural gas mostly replaced coal as Alberta's primary sources of energy.

## Top 25 Coal Power Countries in 2020 
14.07.2022Ember's recent Global Electricity Review revealed that coal generation fell a record 4% (-346 TWh) in 2020. However, coal remains the world's single largest power source, generating 34% of global electricity in 2020 (8736 TWh). As the most carbon-intensive source of electricity, coal power needs to fall by 14% every year this decade to put the world on course

## Coal Power Plant Services 
We have a hundred years of coal-fired power service expertise across 90+ OEM brands, its electricity generation increased just 4.2%. The country needed to quickly find a way to increase power capacity, reliability, and efficiency, while also decreasing emissions. GE's steam turbine services provided a way to tackle this challenge. Up to 6%.

## Land Requirements for PV Versus Coal Energy Generation
Here's the summary then of what we need to meet our annual energy requirements: coal mining requires around 1100km2 of land, or 33km X 33km. solar requires around 2500km2 of land, or 50km X 50kms. So thats about double the space for solar, at worst, being pretty conservative. However, as the life-cycle electricity-output basis study showed in
