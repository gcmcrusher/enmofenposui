## Coal Mining and Processing Methods 
Crushing and breaking. Run-of-mine coal must be crushed to an acceptable top size for treatment in the preparation plant. Typical crushing and breaking devices are feeder breakers, rotary breakers, hammer mills, and roll crushers. Sizing. Different cleaning processes are used on different sizes of coal.

As bituminous coal rank or MFR increased, the amount of coal product fines 250 μm increased while the mass percentage of ATD and ARD liberated from these 250 μm product fines decreased. Air dry loss (ADL) moisture in the coal was found to be inversely related to the dust cloud electrostatic field, influencing dust liberation from the coal product fines.
