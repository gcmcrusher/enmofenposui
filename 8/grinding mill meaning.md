## Jet mill working principle 
Jet mills have no moving parts, thereby eliminating contamination due to contact with external grinding media. It is also an ideal process to grind heat-sensitive and waxy material because no attritional heat is generated. Jet mill works on fluid energy. Consider a pancake spiral jet mill as an example. Micronizing and classification take place
