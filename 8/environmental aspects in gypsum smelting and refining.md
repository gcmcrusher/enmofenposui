## Importance of Environmental Impacts of the Refining Process
25.05.2014The process of oil refining is a way to improve the overall value of the petroleum. It is done in many ways as alluded to in the lesson. The overall objective is, "to add value to a crude oil feed through production of marketable fuels and materials at the lowest possible cost, in accordance with product specifications and environmental regulations."

## Impacts of Smelting 
Impacts on Environment. Smelting is known to be a major cause of pollution in the environment. When smelting occurs, along with the metal produced, a solid waste product, called stag, is also produced [1]. This slag is emitted into the air and can be a cause of the pollution although not a major one. The majority of the pollution is caused by

The pyrometallurgical zinc smelting process produces zinc by taking advantages of the differences in the boiling points of zinc and other components. It mainly includes three processes of roasting, reductive distillation and refining. Higher energy consumption and lower product purity are the two major drawbacks (European Environment Agency, 2019).
