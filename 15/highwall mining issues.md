## Case Study on Stability Analysis of Highwall Mining in India 
The high wall mining system is capable of handling coal seam thickness from 26 to 16 ft with a dip up to 160. Low mining cost. Low labour requirement. Today‟s mining technology prefers more complex problem issues it can analyze by using Numerical Modelling. Examining the different type of rock mass in the mining area are very complicated

## Near Miss 
• Communicate changes in mining methods or blasting issues to oncoming shifts. • Ensure loose material is scaled prior to performing work. To safely scale using the shovel, maintain the highwall height within the reach of the bucket. • Position the shovel and trucks so that the shovel cab swings away from the highwall when loading.

## Evaluation of noise exposures of miners operating highwall mining 
Mar 23, 2010Modern highwall mining systems are starting to replace surface coal augers in some highwall mining operations because of their ability to increase coal production and recovery rates. Another benefit of using highwall mining systems instead of surface coal augers is the reduction in noise exposures to the affected miners extracting the coal from the highwall.

Since 1991, high-wall mining has been used in more than 30 pits at 13 coal mines in Australia [1]. Highwall mining is a remote-controlled mining method for soil slope with height between 10m and 100m or rock slope with height between 15m and 100m. Normally, a series of parallel boreholes are excavated horizontally by using remote-controlled

## A Review of Highwall Mining Experience and Practice
The highwall mining method originated in the USA in the 1940s. The aim of the method was to recover coal from a surface mine that has reached its economic limit. The coal is accessed at the base of the highwall from where a series of parallel entries are driven into the coal seam. Since 1991, highwall mining has been commercially used in Australia in approximately 40 pits at 17
