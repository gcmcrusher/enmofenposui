## Tension control system for rod and bar mills 
A system is disclosed for controlling the tension in rod or bar products being rolled continuously in first and second roll stands independently driven by drive motors. A first surface velocity gauge is positioned at the delivery side of the first roll stand and a second surface velocity gauge is positioned at the entry side of the second roll stand.

## Milling Operations: Maintaining mill balance 
25.03.2019John Wingfield, in the "Dictionary of Milling Terms" published by the International Association of Operative Millers in 1989, defines mill balance as "the proper distribution of stock to the various parts of the milling system, as determined by the flow sheet, to ensure proper loading of equipment and high milling efficiencies.".
