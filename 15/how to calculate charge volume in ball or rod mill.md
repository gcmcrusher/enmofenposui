I'm glad you asked! If you do the G-Wizard free 30-day trial, when it ends, you'll still have access to all the free calculators. The only thing you lose if you choose not to buy at the end of the trial are the Feeds and Speeds-related functions. That still leaves a huge amount of territory–useful time saving tools that are listed below.

## Metal forming processes 
Wire or rod drawing: similar to extrusion, except that the workpiece is pulled through the die opening to take the cross-section. Bulk forming: It is a severe deformation process resulting in massive shape change. The surface area-to-volume of the work is relatively small. Mostly done in hot working conditions.

1. Grinding Ball Charge Mill Menurut Levenson, muatan bola penggiling optimal harus r - 0,16D. Tingkat muatan bola bervariasi dengan batas 25 dan 45%. Sebuah muatan bola di bawah 25% menyebabkan tergelincirnya bola dilapisan mill. Muatan bola di atas 45% menyebabkan gangguan sepanjang lintasan media penggilingan.

Attrition mill : IN this case, the charge is ground to fine size by the action of a vertical shaft with side arms attached to it. The ball to charge ratio may be 5:1, 10:1, 15:1. This method is more efficient in achieving fine particle size. Rod mills: Horizontal rods are used instead of balls to grind. Granularity of the
