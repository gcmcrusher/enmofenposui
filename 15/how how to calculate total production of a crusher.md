3.1 Introduction. The unit cost of logging or road construction is essentially derived by dividing cost by production. In its simplest case, if you rented a tractor with operator for $60 per hour - including all fuel and other costs - and you excavated 100 cubic meters per hour, your unit cost for excavation would be $0.60 per cubic meter.

27.05.2020The main problem with this approach to churn rate calculation is that it makes assumptions about the data. If you calculate this over 3 months, you come out with a churn rate of 15.52%. Divide this across the 3 months, and you get 5.17%, very close to the individual monthly customer churn rates. So far so good.

For equipment rated in amperes, you can convert amps to watts with the following formula: For resistive loads (most common type): Wattage = amperes x volts. For reactive loads: Wattage = amperes x volts x load factor. Load factor is the ratio of your electric energy use in kilowatt-hours to your peak demand in kilowatts.
