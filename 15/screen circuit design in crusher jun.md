## Abstract— Keywords IJSER
a) Primary crusher The raw material from mines is – processed first in primary crushers.. The input of such crushers is relatively wider and the output products are coarser in size. Example - Jaw crusher, Gyratory crusher. b) Secondary crusher- The crushed rocks from primary crusher are sent to secondary crusher for further size reduction.

## The screening process: a vital component of the crushing circuit
Jan 20, 2022Screen and crusher material feed presentation alone can make or break a plant. Mechanical parts, process and post commissioning audits are often required to ensure the plant runs according to the targets. For its part, Metso Outotec sees itself as not only as a provider of screens and other equipment but also as a long-term partner.

## Energy and Cost Comparisons of HPGR
The results showed that the HPGR-ball mill circuit achieved a 21% reduction in energy consumption over the existing SAG-ball mill circuit at the same P80 grind size of 160 mircons (μm). At a grind of 80% passing 75 μm, the HPGR-stirred mill circuit showed a 34% reduction in energy compared to the base case.

## The Benefits Of An Impact Crusher Portable Plant
A Primary And Secondary Crusher In One. Using a screen and an impact crusher, you can create a two-stage crushing circuit. First, you run the feed through the crusher to create a coarse aggregate. Then you run the same feed through the circuit a second time for your final product.
