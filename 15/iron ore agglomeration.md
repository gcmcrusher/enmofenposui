## [PDF] Innovative Development on Agglomeration of Iron Ore 
Oct 08, 2018ABSTRACT In steel industry and in mines, a significant amount of ultra-fines waste iron oxides and iron ore fines is generated. Utilizations of these fines are required to reduce the environmental hazards and conserve the natural resources. Some of these fines are normally used in sintering practice. However, sintering has a limitation of accepting ultra-fines materials.

Mar 11, 2022Sintering is a method of ore treatment, it is a very useful method for iron ore. It may be defined as "material is heating that concentrate particle at the high temperature below its melting point value". The agglomeration continues as the ore proceeds through the kiln and is heated at a temperature of 1200 to 1500 oC. A grate cooler

Jul 30, 2019This book focuses on agglomeration, or the size enlargement process, of iron ores. This process sits at the interface of mineral processing and extractive metallurgy. The book begins with a discussion of raw materials preparation and the beneficiation process. It then describes fundamental principles of the sintering and pelletization processes
