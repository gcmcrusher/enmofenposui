25.05.20182.1 Air pollution and power plants in China. Power generation in China relies heavily on coal consumption, which has become one of the major sources of air pollution in China. From the evolution of the spatial distribution of coal-fired power plants and air pollution, we observe that the areas with high capacity of coal power plants are also the
