## Lithium Mining 
What is Lithium. Lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, and batteries. It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl (Si2O 5) 2, lepidolite K (Li,Al) 3 (Al,Si,Rb) 4 O 10 (F,OH) 2, spodumene LiAl (SiO 3) 2 and also subsurface brines. Australia and Chile are the world's largest producers of lithium.

## What is Process Mining? 
Process mining specifically uses event log data to generate process models which can be used to discover, compare, or enhance a given process. The scope of data mining is much broader, and it extends to a variety of data sets. It is used to observe and predict behaviors, having applications within customer churn, fraud detection, and market

26.04.2018Gold, a lustrous and valuable metal, is excavated from mines in large quantities. No doubt, there was a time when prospectors acquired the burnished yellow ore by pulling out rusty sifting pans, but that's no longer the case. No, heavy duty mining equipment is now used to extract massive loads of gold. That mechanized process begins on the day diggers arrive at

Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury. In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant

## Assay definition and its mining uses 
In metallurgy and chemical analysis, an assay is a process used to determine proportions of precious metals in ores and other metallurgy substances such as silver or gold. It is important to use a precise method when identifying pollutants present within a sample, especially when certain metals in low concentrations indicate a high level of pollution in a mining site.
