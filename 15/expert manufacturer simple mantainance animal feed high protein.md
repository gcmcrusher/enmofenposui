Crude protein (CP) is calculated based on the nitrogen content of the feedstuff. Protein is made up of approximately 16% nitrogen, and in the lab, total nitrogen is measured and multiplied by 6.25 (100/16) to report it on a 'crude protein' basis. Generally a corn silage sample will range between 7%–9% CP and haylage 18%–24% CP.
