The diatomite has two significant impacts on their photocatalytic performance: (1) enhancing the dispersion of BiVO 4 crystallites due to its high porosity and specific surface area to favor their photocatalytic performance, and (2) having a light screening effect to incident visible light to decrease their photocatalytic activity.
