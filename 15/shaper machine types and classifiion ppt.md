## Parts Classification and Coding 
The part codes can be used to design machine cells capable of producing all members of a particular part family, using the composite part concept (Section 15.4.1). To accomplish parts classification and coding requires examination and analysis of the design and/or manufacturing attributes of each part. The examination is sometimes done.
