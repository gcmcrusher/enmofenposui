## Coal 
07/05/2020Long before Alberta's first oil and gas boom, the province relied on coal to heat homes, generate electricity, and provide fuel for transportation. Coal was also the first energy commodity to be exported from the province, starting in the late 1800s. By the 1960s, however, oil and natural gas mostly replaced coal as Alberta's primary sources of energy.
