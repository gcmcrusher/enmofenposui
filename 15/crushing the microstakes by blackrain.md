## Any reviews for Crushing the Microstakes? 
21.09.2015Crushing the Microstakes is primarily targeted at NL2, NL4 and NL5 cash games. It will be helpful at higher stakes but it does not represent a complete guide for these games. This is why I have recently released another book (Modern Small Stakes) which targets NL10 and the upper end of the micros. Both books are applicable to 6max and Zoom games.
