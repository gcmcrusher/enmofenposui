Solution: 1. The volume of the soil sample equals the volume of the cylinder. A cylinder's volume (V) equals = € r 2 h cubic unit. 2. The bulk density of a soil can be calculated on the basis of dry weight of that soil divided by its volume. Thus, Bulk density = Wt. of soil mass/Soil volume. =

## Density of Construction Materials in kg/m3 and lb/ft3
Density is also called as unit weight of substance. It is represented by symbol called row ( p). Density represents the degree of compactness of material. If the material is of more density, it is more compacted material. Density is defined as the ratio of mass to volume. p = m/v Units = kg/m 3 or lb/ft 3 Conversion: 1 kg/m 3 = 0.624 lb/ft 3.

FDT is a in-situ density test of soil that is used in various types of construction works like highways, DAM construction, Embankment filling, and backfilling in order to access the quality of density achieved at site. FDT like many other tests on soil in civil engineering is a quality control tests.
