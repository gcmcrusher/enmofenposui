## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores
This process uses a series of physical steps and high temperatures to extract and purify copper from copper sulfide ores, in four basic steps: 1) froth flotation, 2) thickening, 3) smelting, and 4) electrolysis. Following mining, transporting, and crushing to a consistent gravel or golf ball-size, the crushed ore is further processed at a mill

## Image analysis technique as a tool for extracting features 
In the flotation cell, the performance of the cell is highly dependent on the morphology of the surface froth. Consequently, to control the metallurgical performance of the cell (i.e., copper grade, concentrate recovery and mass flow rate), continuous observation of the froth features (i.e., texture and color froth) by an operator is crucial.
