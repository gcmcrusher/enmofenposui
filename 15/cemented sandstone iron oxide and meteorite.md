## Sandstone 
Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized (0.0625 to 2 mm) silicate grains. Sandstones comprise about 20–25% of all sedimentary rocks.. Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar (both silicates)

## Effect of Arenite, Calcareous, Argillaceous, and Ferruginous Sandstone 
16.04.2019Ferruginous sandstone is a sandstone with more than 15 percent of iron oxides (e.g., hematite). The iron oxides occur as pore-filling and grain-coating materials and stained rock with the reddish brown colour . Calcareous sandstone is composed of more than 15 percent of carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite) as cementing materials.

13.08.2019Sandstone Basics. Sandstone is a type of rock made from sediment — a sedimentary rock. The sediment particles are clasts, or pieces, of minerals and fragments of rock, thus sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock. It is composed mostly of sand particles, which are of medium size; therefore, sandstone is a medium-grained clastic sedimentary rock.

Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized (0.0625 to 2 mm) silicate grains. Sandstones comprise about 20–25% of all sedimentary rocks.. Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar (both silicates) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth's surface.

06.09.2019Sandstone. Sandstone is composed of mineral grains (commonly quartz) cemented together by silica, iron oxide, or calcium carbonate. Sandstones are typically white, gray, brown, or red. Red and brown sandstones are colored by iron oxide impurities. Most sandstones feel gritty, and some are easily crushed (friable) and break up to form sand.

It's an iron oxide, cemented sandstone, said Tim McCoy, curator of meteorites at the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of Natural History in Washington. He examined the stone yesterday. These rocks are very common in the Eastern United States, and they are commonly confused with meteorites, McCoy said.
