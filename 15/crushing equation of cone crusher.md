## Crusher 
A cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear-resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a

## Modelling of flow in cone crushers 
The possibility to simulate and predict cone crusher performance is of great interest for the development of crushers as well as for the design and optimization of crushing plants. To calculate the output from a cone crusher, models for size reduction and flow are needed. The interaction between these two models is quite complex as the overall

## Forces in a Cone Crusher 
21.03.2019For cone crushers, this ratio is between 3 : 1 and 10 : 1 for primary crushing; between 6 : 1 and 8 : 1 for secondary crushing; and up to 10 : 1 for tertiary crushing . In research on the design and performance of cone crushers, it is generally assumed that crushing occurs as a result of the compression of the piece by mobile and immobile cones.

## TECHNICAL NOTES 5 CRUSHERS
Cone crushers are commonly used for secondary, tertiary and quaternary crushing duties. Two variations are available - standard and short head The chief difference between cone and gyratory or jaw crushers is the nearly parallel arrangement of the mantle and the cone at the discharge end in the cone crusher. This is illustrated in Figure 5.2. Reduction ratios in the
