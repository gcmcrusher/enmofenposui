## Purity or power: India's coal quandary 
India's resistance on the issue is driven by its desire to distribute the benefits of development more widely among its 1.3 billion people, some of whom still have no access to electricity. But it comes at a heavy price. In Singrauli, home to more than a dozen mines and coal-fired power stations, dark soot covers trees, houses, cars and even

Aboitiz Power's proposal received outright support from Vice Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, who challenged environment groups to present alternatives to the pressing power shortfall. Mayor Duterte said power plants that could turn waste into energy might be a much better option but no one is investing in this project because it's "quite expensive."
