08.01.2020Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed of the carbonate mineral calcite and can vary greatly in its appearance, depending on how it is formed, but can easily be identified by its chemical weathering. Limestone composed of calcite undergoes dissolution in acids, meaning it effervesces dramatically when we apply dilute HCl.

## Lime Production: Industry Profile 
Limestone is a general term that covers numerous varieties of sedimentary rock. Limestone can be composed of the following four minerals, plus impurities: calcite (CaCO 3), aragonite (also CaCO 3 but with a different crystal structure from calcite), dolomite (CaMg(CO 3) 2), and magnesite (MgCO 3) (Boynton, 1980). Limestone can be categorized as either high calcium

These compositional zones are interpreted as'time stratigraphic'

## Limestone Facts
Limestone is a sedimentary rock that contains at least 50% calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Because sedimentary rocks are made of various types of sediments, the other 50% of a limestone rock could be virtually any other mineral. Limestone originates in wet areas which mean it could also be composed of shells and waste matter from organisms.
