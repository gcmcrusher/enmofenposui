## Crush Cans Effortlessly with an Arduino
. Build the crusher. The basic structure of the crusher is a length of 24 wood. At one end, the actuator is anchored using the fixtures supplied with it. The actuator's shaft is then fixed to a block of wood that crushes cans against an end stop. Two plywood sides help prevent the can escaping while it's being crushed.
