## Ground Stone Artifacts 
A wide range of prehistoric artifacts were formed by pecking, grinding, or polishing one stone with another. Ground stone tools are usually made of basalt, rhyolite, granite, or other macrocrystalline igneous or metamorphic rocks, whose coarse structure makes them ideal for grinding other materials, including plants and other stones.

The HGB is preserved predominantly as amphibolites, which are the oldest rocks in the Huangling basement. The protoliths of most amphibolites are ultramafic–mafic volcanic rocks (3.2–3.0 Ga; Wei et al., 2020), which formed a greenstone belt that was intruded by TTG (3.0–2.9 Ga; Gao and Zhang, 1990, Li et al., 2014, Guo et al., 2015), and these rocks

Here gold is associated in the margins of belts of metamorphosed volcanic rocks commonly referred to as greenstone. Almost without exception, the major gold deposits of Ghana and the rest of West Africa lie at or close to the contact margins of these greenstone belts where they meet up with other rocks like schist, and these structural contacts are often strongly deformed
