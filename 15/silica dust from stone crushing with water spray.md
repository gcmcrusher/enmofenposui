Deadly Dust. Silica dust is very fine, much smaller than a tiny grain of sand found on a beach. This is what makes it so easy to inhale. If you look at the full stop at the end of the previous sentence, that is around micrometres in diameter. Whereas the respirable crystalline silica particle is only 5 micrometres in size.

Most types of rock and products containing rock contain varying amounts of silica. For example, the composite stone may contain up to 90% silica while granite typically contains 25% to 40% silica. When workers crush, cut, drill, grind, saw, or polish stone or man-made products containing silica, they release silica dust into the air.

## Silica 
This information focuses on respirable crystalline silica, which is the more hazardous form. Silica is a major constituent of many types of sand. It is also a component of concrete and some bricks and rocks (eg granite, slate, sandstone). As such, this hazard can be found in industries such as construction, masonry, mining and foundries.
