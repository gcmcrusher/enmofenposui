## Hydrated Lime 
Hydrated lime is preferable in certain industries as it is more safe and stable in normal condition. It is a dry powder produced by reacting quicklime with a sufficient amount of water to satisfy the quicklime's natural affinity for moisture. The process converts CaO to Ca(OH)2. The amount of water required depends on both the subtle characteristics of the quicklime and the type of
