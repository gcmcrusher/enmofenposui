## Ore crusher dust pollution treatment method 
May 08, 2018The ore crusher equipment can be dust-collected by means of a dust-tight method. Due to the simple process and high degree of mechanization, remote control can be used to further reduce and eliminate the chance of dust exposure by operators. This is a very effective solution to the problem of dust generation in ore crushers.

## Iron Ore Processing 
The geological grade of the ore deposit is relatively high (about 50%), but the ore body is thinner or has more interlayers. The waste rock is mixed in during mining to dilute the ore. For this kind of ore, only crushing and no-grinding can be used so coarse-grained tailings are discarded through re-election to recover the geological grade.
