## Basalt 
Basalt is used because it has good resistance to mechanical stress and impact. The material can be produced by reducing the size of the rocks using MB's crusher bucket. When selecting and separating the fine and large rocks, the process can be done quickly and easily with the screening bucket: the fines come out of the basket while the larger rocks remain in the bucket.

## Basalt 
Basalt is an igneous rock that contains more than 45 and less than 52% of SiO 2 and less than five percent of total alkalies (K 2 O + Na 2 O) 3. Neighboring rock types like basaltic andesite, basanite, picrite (picrobasalt), trachybasalt and even more distant rocks like phonotephrite or andesite may have very similar look and can be easily mistaken for basalt in many cases.
