The oxidation roasting of carbon-bearing micro-fine gold can eliminate or weaken the robbing effect of carbonaceous materials and clay, and destroy the encapsulation of micro-fine gold. The micropores produced by gas escaping during the roasting process are conducive to the diffusion of leaching agents, thus enhancing the cyanide leaching of gold. In this paper,
