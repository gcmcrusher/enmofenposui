## From Ore Body to High Temperature Processing of Complex Ores: Manganese 
Manganese is considered a relatively rare metal as concentrations of it in ore of commercial importance are geographically limited. In nature, manganese is found in the form of oxides, carbonates, and silicates. Manganese ores are complex in the sense that they not only consist of a complex oxide mineral assemblage but these minerals are also very finely inter
