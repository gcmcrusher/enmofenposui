21/02/2020High-speed steel, a grade of tool steels, has a few alloying elements added to it to provide better response to heat and wear than a regular carbon steel. While the life cycle of such a tool goes up, so does the cost. Loses its hardness at 600 C. Therefore, higher milling speeds are suitable for these tool steels.

## Machining Tungsten Alloys [Quick Tips, Feeds Speeds]
Proper feeds and speeds are essential to be sure as much heat as possible is carried out with the chip. In most cases, alloys are much preferred over pure Tungsten which is the most problematic to machine. The machining of Tungsten Alloys has been compared to machining gray cast iron (it's highly abrasive) or in some cases, stainless steel.

Other tips for good finish in milling are: i. Use climb or down milling. In conventional or up milling, the cutting edge starts with zero chip thickness and digs into the material; creating lot of rubbing action before the edge can actually get a bite. This rubbing action causes pressure and heat build-up at the finished surface.

May 26, 2021Milling. When performing milling operation, avoid plunging engagements in favor of surface ramping motions. If you don't have any other option, then use the pecking cycle to reduce the chip's length. These chips will stick to the tool and melt the acrylic material through friction. It will also block the coolant path to reach your cutting tool.
