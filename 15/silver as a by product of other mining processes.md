Silver mining is the resource extraction of silver by mining. Silver is found in a native form very rarely as nuggets, but morebined with sulfur, arsenic, antimony, or chlorine and in various ores such as argentite Ag2S, chlorargyrite horn silver, AgCl, and galena a leadore often containing significant amounts of silver.

However silver is mostly obtained as a byproduct in the refining of other metals. World production of newly mined silver is around 17.000 tonnes per year, of which only about a quarter comes from silver mines. The rest is a byproduct of refining other metals.

## Mining 
Mining in Europe has a very long history. Examples include the silver mines of Laurium, which helped support the Greek city state of Athens.Although they had over 20,000 slaves working them, their technology was essentially identical to their Bronze Age predecessors. At other mines, such as on the island of Thassos, marble was quarried by the Parians after they

Lead - Essential Chemical Industry. The molten lead is tapped off from the base of the furnace and either cast into, typically, 4 tonne ingots or put into a 'holding kettle' which keeps the metal molten for the refining process The product contains about 995% lead, the remaining 05% being mostly antimony and silver with smaller amounts of other metals, including gold

## Mining industry and sustainable development: time for change
In gold mining, two main processes, one based on mercury and the other based on cyanide, are used to aggregate gold dust after its segregation from the placer deposit or from the ore-bearing rock. These processes are very toxic to the artisanal community and to the environment, in particular, to rivers where all the chemical waste is dumped (e.g. Amazon River).

## How is Silver Mined 
Silver also occurs alongside lead, copper and zinc ores, which is why nearly 50% of mined Silver today is obtained when processing other kinds of ore. Silver is separated from this ore using a chemical process known as smelting. To begin a new Silver mine, a system of multi-layered crosscuts are made.

## 33 Causes, Effects Solutions for Mining 
One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.

## How Gold Is Mined 
The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity – known as dor – typically containing between 60-90% gold. During its life, a number of factors – such as the

Silver has long been valued for its white metallic lustre, its ability to be readily worked, and its resistance to the corrosive effects of moisture and oxygen. The lustre of the pure metal is due to its electron configuration, which results in its reflecting all electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths longer
