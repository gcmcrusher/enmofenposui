What is the primary process that turns sediments into sedimentary rocks? Lithification (Diagenesis) – Lithification is the process that turns sediment into rock. The first stage of the process is compaction. Compaction occurs as the weight of the overlying material increases.

## Sedimentary Rocks 
Organic Sedimentary Rocks. Organic sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation of any animal or plant debris such as shells and bones. These plant and animal debris have calcium minerals in them that pile on the sea floor over time to form organic sedimentary rocks. Examples include rocks such as coal, some limestone, and some dolomites.
