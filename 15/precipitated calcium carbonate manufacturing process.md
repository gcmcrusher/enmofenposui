## METHOD FOR INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURE OF PRECIPITATED CALCIUM CARBONATE 
Method for industrial manufacture of pure (precipitated) CaCO3 comprising providing at least one naturally occurring carbonate bearing rock and comminuting said rock to increase its surface area. In a first reaction zone (R1) the comminuted carbonate bearing rock is contacted with water and CO2 at a pressure higher than standard pressure, at a temperature in the range 30-500

## Why is Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) Preferred in Paper?
This manufacturing freedom allows us to produce PCC in various crystal habits, each with unique properties and advantages. Synthesized PCC is also inherently whiter and brighter than kaolin clay or many GCCs. Manufacturing flexibility also allows us to prepare precipitated calcium carbonate on-site at the paper mill in our own nearby PCC

## Production of Precipitated Calcium Carbonate from Steel 
01/01/2014Precipitated calcium carbonate, a widely used filler material, is nowadays mainly produced by the so-called carbonation process. Thus, in case calcium could be brought into a PCC manufacturing process with a smaller carbon dioxide penalty, the process route would contribute to mitigating CO 2 emissions and global climate change.
