## Economic evaluation of mineral deposits 
Jan 01, 198623 Economic evaluation of mineral deposits Economic evaluation of a deposit is of a complex character and is thus referred to as geologico-economic or technical-economic evaluation. A deposit must be evaluated using a complex of parameters since no reliable synthesizing index for determining the economic value of a deposit is available.
