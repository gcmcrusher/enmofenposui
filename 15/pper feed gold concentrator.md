## Artisanal and Small
12/01/2022Operating a centrifuge takes skill as it must be tuned to the material it is processing. This is accomplished by adjusting feed grain size, rate of feed, rotation velocity, and cycle duration. Centrifuges can be more effective at concentrating gold than other methods of gravity concentration but are generally more expensive.

01.10.1992This work investigated operating a laboratory scale Knelson Concentrator with a dry feed and using air as the fluidising medium. The feed used was a synthetic mixture of tungsten and quartz, used to mimic a gold ore. The response surface method and central composite design techniques were used to design the experiments and to model the results
