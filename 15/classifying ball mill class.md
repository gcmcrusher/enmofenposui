The profiling of the shell lining plates creates the movement of the ball charge, which causes the grinding of the material. It is therefore essential for effective grinding in the mill and far more than just a wear part. The exact profile shape has to be defined depending on the ball sizes used, the rotation pace and the mill diameter.
