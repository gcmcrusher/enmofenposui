## Hydrated Lime 
Hydrated lime (or calcium hydroxide, or slaked lime) is usually a dry powder resulting from the controlled slaking of quicklime with water. The exothermic or released heat of reaction is captured and used to evaporate the excess slaking water. Chemical formula: Ca (OH)2. Chemical composition of Hydrated Lime available in each grade.

## Hydrated Lime Market 
Hydrated lime is available in the form of a dry powder, and is less chemically reactive as compared to quicklime. Hydrated lime is produced by adding water to lime during the manufacturing process, also known as slaking. Key parameters based on which the hydrated lime market is divided are application, end-use industry, and region.
