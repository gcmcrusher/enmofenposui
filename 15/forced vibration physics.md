## Forced Oscillation and Resonance – Definition and Types
Resonance is a particular case of forced oscillation. When the frequency difference between the system and that of the external force is minimal, the resultant amplitude of the forced oscillations will be enormous. However, when the two frequencies match or become the same, resonance occurs. Thus, at resonance, the amplitude of forced

Jul 28, 1998The forced vibration of strings has much in common with, on the one hand, their free vibration and, on the other hand, the forced harmonic motion of single objects. But there are also peculiarities, some of which are investigated here. It is found useful to distinguish two kinds of forcing; and some suggestions are made about vibrating strings

## What have forced vibrations? 
The vibrations of a body under the action of an external periodic force in which the body vibrates with a frequency equal to the frequency of an external periodic force (driving frequency) other than natural frequency are called forced vibrations.

Forced Oscillations. In order to sustain oscillations in a simple harmonic system, a periodic force must be applied to replace the energy lost in damping. This periodic force does work on the resistive force decreasing the oscillations; It is sometimes known as an external driving force These are known as forced oscillations (or vibrations), and are defined as:

## What is free vibration and forced vibration? 
In free vibration, energy will remain the same. Energy is not added or removed from the body. The body keeps vibrating at the same amplitude. In forced vibration energy gets added to the vibrating body. The forced vibration is either damped or undamped. In an undamped forced vibration amplitude increases with time. In a forced damped vibration

## Forced Vibration AQA A Level Physics
Forced Vibration. Forced vibration is where a driving force is continuously applied to make the system vibrate/oscillate. The thing that provides the driving force will be moving at a certain frequency. We call this the driving frequency.

## All resonances are forced vibrations 
Physics. All resonances are forced vibrations. Physics. This type of periodic vibration is called forced vibration. Resonance is said to occur when a particular body or a system is set in oscillation at its own natural frequency by an external source which vibrating with the same frequency. So resonance is a special type of forced vibration.
