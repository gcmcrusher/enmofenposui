materials were introduced at the bottom of the mill with surrounding air through the inlet. The materials were then ground by means of swirling shear flow, eddies generated by the blades and impact with the walls. After grinding, the materials were discharged to a bag filter. Figure 2 shows a cross-sectional diagram of the mechanical impact mill.
