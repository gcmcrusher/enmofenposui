## What Causes Clinkers in Coal
10/01/2022Clinkers are a problem when they form in coal-fired boilers. Coal-fired boilers were once commonly used in American homes in the days before electricity. Coal burns hotter and longer than wood, but coal, like wood, can produce leftover chunks called clinkers. To make the boiler run more efficiently, the clinkers must be removed.

Riley Power recently participated in field testing on a wall fired boiler rated at 1,779,000 lb/hr of main steam flow. The boiler is an opposed fired design with two (2) levels of burners on both the front and rear walls. The natural gas supply system to the boiler utilized a single flow control valve for all the burners.

22/09/2010Present regulatory requirements enforces the modification of the firing modes of existing coal-fired utility boilers and the use of coals different from those originally designed for these boilers. The reduction of SO 2 and NO x emissions were the primary motivation for these changes. However, economic considerations played a major role too.

In addition to almost any coal, many byprod- ucts and waste fuels (e.g., coke breeze, wood wastes, wood bark, and bagasse) can be burned successfully in stoker-fired boilers. However, pulverized coal-fired boilers can change load more rapidly. Figure 1 shows a simplified cross section of a typical industrial, na- tural-circulation boiler.

## Influence of Coal Quality on Boiler Combustion 
The particle size of coal has great influence on the combustion of the boiler. When the particles are excessive large, in the combustion process, the coal particles have too short time to stay in the boiler. Coke in coal cannot be burnt out. The carbon content in slag rises, and the physical heat loss of boiler slag increases.
