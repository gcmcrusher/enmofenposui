## Iron ore beneficiation 
Beneficiation is the use of technological methods for the improvement of quality and structure of iron ores so as to render them usable in current smelting operations or to improve their usability. In considering the utilization of beneficiation on low-grade iron ores, it is first necessary to examine the need for such treatment. This need is directly related to the reserves of high

## Process of Iron Ore Beneficiation for Fines 
Once deposits of iron ore are extracted from the ground. They must be processed in order to increase the iron content and decrease the concentration of gangue minerals. This process is known as beneficiation. Depending on the type of processing equipment, the iron ore beneficiation process can take many steps, or it can take just two.

iron ore resources have become a national priority. As per the recent national steel policy, our country will be producing about 110 million tons of steel per annum by 2020 requiring around 42 million tons of iron ore. The iron ore exports are projected to a level of 114 million tones and it amounts to total production of 300 million tons by 2020.

On the east side of Trout Lake, near Coleraine and Bovey, the first iron ore concentrator on the Mesabi Iron Range was built. The ores of the western Mesabi needed "washing" to be rid of the silica sand mixed in, and this huge concentrator did the job.
