Single stage SAG Mills are very beneficial in reducing CAPEX for plants with a staged throughput approach. When future tonnage is to be increased, the SAG Mill can feed downstream ball milling to boost capacity. Fuller-Traylor SAG/AG Mills range in size from 4.3m through 12.2m in diameter with powers as high as 28,000 kW.
