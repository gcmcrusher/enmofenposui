The mineral value on the claim is gold. Light panning in the creek behind the cabin produced small grains of gold. An average small operation could reasonably expect to extract 1-1.5 oz per day if processing 1 ton per day. The region is also known for its gold production, though the larger, well-known gold mines are located much farther north.
