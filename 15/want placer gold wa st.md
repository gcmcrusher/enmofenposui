Native gold, R30017. Source: Geoscience Australia. Gold, like iron, copper, lead and tin is a metal. Gold is the only yellow metal and is chemically very stable. It does not readily combine with other substances and, therefore, does not corrode or tarnish. Because of this property, it is almost always found in nature as pure gold.

Placer gold was found in the creeks and streams thus leading to the gold mines including Reed mine. The boom lasted until around 1820's and 1830's.
