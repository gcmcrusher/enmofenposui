Cement is produced by co-grinding clinker, gypsum and other components defined in the Ce-ment Standards like limestone, pozzolans, fly ash and slag. The grinding is usually performed in hor-izontal ball mills. Gypsum is typically the basic source of sulphates (SO 3) in the cement. The effect of gypsum on the cement quality is critical and two-fold.
