Baryte, or barite is a mineral consisting of barium sulfate. It is generally white or colorless, and is the main source of barium. Some 77% worldwide is used as a weighting agent for drilling fluids in oil and gas exploration to suppress high formation pressures and prevent blowouts. An additional benefit of barite is that it is non-magnetic

## Barite 
In natural settings, barite frequently replaces other minerals such as celestite. Also, it sometimes replaces organic materials such as wood, shells and fossils. As an ore, barite is the primary source of barium. Barite also is used in the manufacture of paper, paint and glass, in medical radiology, and in drilling oil wells. Facts

Barite. Barite is a mineral composed of barium sulphate (BaSO4). It receives its name from the Greek word "baryte" which means "heavy.". This name is in response to barite's high specific gravity of 4.5, which is exceptional for a non-metallic mineral. Baryte is generally white or colorless, and is the main source of barium.
