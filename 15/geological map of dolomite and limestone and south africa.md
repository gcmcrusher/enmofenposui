Geology of South Africa. South Africa is the country at the southernmost corner of Africa. Cape Town, the capital, is named after the Cape, the southernmost point of the African continent. This country has numerous famous geological features, which are rather easy to visit, because of the dry climate with no or little vegetation hiding the geology.

The term 'dolomitic land' is used to describe areas in South Africa underlain directly or at shallow depth (i.e. 100m) by the rock type dolomite. Dolomitic rock is composed of the mineral dolomite, which is a carbonate of calcium and magnesium. 2.2 Why is dolomitic land problematical? Dolomite is soluble, i.e. dissolves in water.
