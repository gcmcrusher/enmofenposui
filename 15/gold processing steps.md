## Lithium Mining 
What is Lithium. Lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, and batteries. It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl (Si2O 5) 2, lepidolite K (Li,Al) 3 (Al,Si,Rb) 4 O 10 (F,OH) 2, spodumene LiAl (SiO 3) 2 and also subsurface brines. Australia and Chile are the world's largest producers of lithium.

## Artisanal and Small
12.01.2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

## How is gold mined? 
09.08.2022In placer mining, the gold is retrieved by metal detecting, panning, cradling, sluicing and dredging. Using gravity and water to separate the dense gold from the other materials that surround it, this is the most common gold mining category for amateur gold hunters. Hard rock mining is the process of using open pit or underground mining tunnels

## Steps taken in processing gold 
Step 6 Mining samples and determining processing. Once mining gets underway, samples must be taken to determine the precise metallurgical qualities of the ore. This is done in order to determine the appropriate processing technique. Step 7 Processing (onsite) Once ore is extracted, processing it into pure g must be done.
