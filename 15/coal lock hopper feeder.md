## How to Design Efficient and Reliable Feeders for Bulk Solids
There are two basic types of feeders used in industrial plants: volumetric and gravimetric. As its name implies, a volumetric feeder modulates and controls the volumetric rate of discharge from a bin (e.g., cu. ft./hr.). The four most common types of such feeders are screw, belt, rotary valve, and vibrating pan. A gravimetric feeder, on the

## Hopper design 
Feeders are positioned after a hopper to control the discharge, dose the solid if necessary, or reach another unit operation while reducing the height of the installation (case of screw and vibrating feeders). 4 feeders are considered here and cover most of the cases in the industry : simple butterfly valves, pneumatic rotary valves or Airlock rotary Valves, screw feeders and
