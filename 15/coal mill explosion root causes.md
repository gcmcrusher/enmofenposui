## How Flour Dust Caused The Washburn Mill Explosion 
Mar 16, 2020From where he worked, Grundman saw two of the millstones run dry, sending off a deadly spark. The dust in the flues quickly caught fire and pressure built up rapidly as the burning particulate released expansive gasses, turning the giant flour mill into a powder keg. Just after 7 pm, three enormous explosions rocked the mill.

If the event is confined by an enclosure such as a building, room, vessel, or process equipment, the resulting pressure rise may cause an explosion. These five factors (oxygen, heat, fuel, dispersion, and confinement) are known as the "Dust Explosion Pentagon".
