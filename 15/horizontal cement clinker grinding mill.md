Step 6 : Finish Grinding. The clinker is ground in a ball mill—a horizontal steel tube filled with steel balls. As the tube rotates, the steel balls tumble and crush the clinker into a super-fine powder. It can now be considered Portland cement. The cement is so fine it will easily pass through a sieve that is fine enough to hold water.
