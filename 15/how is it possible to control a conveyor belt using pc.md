## Conveyor system fire prevention 
Conveyor system fire prevention. The transport of materials is a key activity for most industries. For many of these tasks, conveyor belt systems offer a cost effective and efficient solution. However, with such a system comes a high risk of fire due to heat generated by belt friction and fire risks associated with the material conveyed.

## Belts and Pulleys 
Aug 24, 2012Manufacturers generally describe belts and pulleys with five main geometries. Pitch diameter is the drive pulley's diameter. Center distance is the distance between the two pulleys' centers. Minimum wrap angle is a measure of how much the belt wraps around the smallest pulley. Belt length is how long the belt would be if cut and laid flat.

Belt control normally consists of the net sum of the belt permissives, the operator start/stop stations, the start warning system, interlock sequencing of individual conveyors and other process controls. Belt control initiates a run command to the drive controller. Sometimes the belt control issues a running reference speed to the drive controller.
