## Dust Extractor or Cyclone? 
Jan 21, 2008A really big collector (usually a cyclone) is only really needed if you want a permanent, ducted installation, and if you're just starting out you will probably move your tools around too much over the next few years anyway. By the way, the current issue of Wood Magazine has a test of $400 dust collectors. Reply.

Cyclone separators operate by incorporating centrifugal, gravitational, and inertial forces to remove fine particles suspended in air or gas. These types of separators use cyclonic action to separate particulates from a gas stream.

## Introduction to Cyclones 
A cyclone is a device that uses centrifugal forces to classify solid particles, in a liquid stream, by size and/or density. What does a Cyclone do? If a cyclone is fed with a sand and water mixture containing a range of particle sizes, most of the fine sand will report to the overflow (the top of the cyclone), together with most of the water.
