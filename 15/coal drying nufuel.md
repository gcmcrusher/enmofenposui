## Deterioration Mechanism and Constitutive Model of Coal 
The stability of coal pillar dams is influenced by cyclic fluctuations of salty water from underground reservoir. Subjected to long-term drying-wetting cycles in salty solution, the microstructure and surface topography of coal dams can be significantly changed which results in the deterioration of mechanical properties.
