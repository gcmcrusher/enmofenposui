## Mineral Mining and Processing Effluent Guidelines 
After extraction, many types of raw minerals are then subject to processes such as crushing, milling, washing and chemical treatments. Wastewater is generated during mineral processing (e.g., stone cutting, wash water, scrubber water), from equipment cooling, from mine dewatering, and from stormwater runoff at mines and processing plants.
