The belt is fitted with appropriate intensity on the frame. Now we connect a motor to one of the rollers. The motor nor moves the roller which inturn moves the belt. This in turn moves the other rollers in order to move objects over it at desired speed. Thus we demonstrate the design and fabrication of a mini conveyer belt system.

## The Analysis of a Conveyor Belt System a case study in Hybrid 
Using the process algebra CRLt a case study on a conveyor belt system has been conducted (see [12]). The great complexity allowed for a thorough identification of gaps in the formalism for applications in the area of hybrid systems. The models in this paper are slightly simplified versions of the models in [12].
