## 4.2 Resource
Resource-based theory contends that the possession of strategic resources provides an organization with a golden opportunity to develop competitive advantages over its rivals ( Table 4.1 "Resource-Based Theory: The Basics" ). These competitive advantages in turn can help the organization enjoy strong profits (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1981).

## Resource Based View 
Introduction. The resource-based view (RBV) is a way of viewing the firm and in turn of approaching strategy. Fundamentally, this theory formulates the firm to be a bundle of resources. It is these resources and the way that they are combined, which make firms different from one another.

## Unitary Perspective of Industrial Relations 
The Unitary perspective of industrial relations views the organisation as a team 'unified by a common purpose', namely the success of the organisation. This perspective views all the people in the organisation as part of one big team. Unitarists view everyone within the organisation as part of one team with one loyalty structure.

## The Succession Process from a Resource‐ and Knowledge‐Based View 
This paper uses two theoretical approaches from the strategic management field to explore this critical process and analyze how it can be managed effectively: the resource-based theory of the firm and the emergent knowledgebased view.

Resource-based-view (RBV) The resource-based view (RBV) maintains that a firm's competitive advantage lies in its ability to utilize a cluster of available intangible and tangible resources,, . These resources are difficult to imitate by competitors and thereby create sustainable value.

## Dynamic capabilities as (workable) management systems theory
This resource-based view of strategic management (e.g., Wernerfelt, Reference Wernerfelt 1984), a forerunner to dynamic capabilities, had a broad influence in strategic management but always suffered from providing only a partial-system approach to building competitive advantage (Priem Butler, Reference Priem and Butler 2001).

## Resource
The resource-based view can be positioned relative to at least three theoretical traditions: SCP-based theories of industry determinants of firm performance, neo-classical microeconomics, and evolutionary economics. In the 1991 article, only the first of these ways of positioning the resourcebased view is explored.

## The resource‐based view of the firm: some stumbling 
The resource‐based view of the firm (RBV) is an important, emerging theory of firm heterogeneity. It is well grounded in industrial economics and has benefited in its development from a multiplicity of contributions by management writers. But like any developing body of knowledge, it is not short of confusion, ambiguity and conceptual and empirical
