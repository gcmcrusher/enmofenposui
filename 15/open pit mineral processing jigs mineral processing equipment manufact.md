Aug 24, 2017The run-of-mine extracted from the ground requires further processing in order to make a marketable product. This preparation is called mineral processing. Thus, ores must go through a number of different operations to obtain the final products: comminution or size reduction, size separation, concentration or beneficiation, and dewatering.

Surface mining is done in five ways: Strip mining – Strip mining is the most common surface mining method used to mine coal and lignite. The process is done by removing a strip of overburden before mining a seam of mineral. Strip mining is done only when the ore body is in close proximity to the surface. Open-pit mining – Open-pit mining is
