24.05.2022In the rolling process, the job is drawn through a set of rolls due to interface friction, and the compressive forces reduce the thickness of the workpiece or change its cross-sectional area.. The types of rolls used in rolling mills are depended upon the shape, size, and the gap between the rolls and their contour. Because of workability and limitations in equipment,

Mill data from the hot strip mill has been used to calculate the mean flow stress in each pass, assuming the material to be elastic – ideally plastic. The roll force model used was a classical slab method with constant friction assumed in the roll gap. For the roughing mill (reversible 4-high) both roll

## Basic clean room design requirements and considerations
There are three things that keep a cleanroom "clean": The internal surfaces of the clean room and the equipment within them; The control and quality of air through the clean room; The way the clean room is operated (i.e. the number of staff). Each of the three items above is equally important. Let's look at them in more detail: 1.

## DESIGN ANALYSIS OF UNIVERSAL JOINT SHAFT FOR ROLLING MILLS 
02.07.2014To obtain the maximum possible reduction per pass, mill designers (particularly on steckel mills) specify the work rolls as small in diameter as possible. The question of how to get the required torque to the work rolls is usually a secondary consideration. As a result, the discard diameter of work rolls is, in many cases, the deciding factor when choosing the size of
