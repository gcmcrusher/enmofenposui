4.1.2 Iron Ore Beneficiation Iron ore occurs naturally in a variety of forms, from sand-like iron fines to solid rock masses. Crude ore, or ore mined in the natural state, seldom occurs in a pure state and requires some form of beneficiation. Crude ore is commonly mixed with other minerals (gangue), which reduce the iron content. Concentrations
