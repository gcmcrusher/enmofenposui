## New research shows proposed coal expansion will cost major 
29/09/2021According to C40's research, the most significant upsurge in coal capacity, and resulting increases in carbon pollution, will impact developing nations, including China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam. If current plans for coal expansion are realized, C40 cities may see up to 264,900 premature deaths attributed to air pollution by 2030.

## Spatial evolution of coal transportation at coastal ports in China
28/02/2018Coal is a basic resource and its use guarantees the development of national economies and human society. Thus, coal transportation is an important part of China's overall transportation system. In this system, ports are the vital transit nodes. This study considered coastal ports in China and analysed the evolution of coal transportation from 1973 to 2013.

## Coal 
coal, one of the most important primary fossil fuels, a solid carbon-rich material that is usually brown or black and most often occurs in stratified sedimentary deposits. Coal is defined as having more than 50 percent by weight (or 70 percent by volume) carbonaceous matter produced by the compaction and hardening of altered plant remains—namely, peat deposits. Different varieties
