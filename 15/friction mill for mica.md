Once in motion, energy is only needed to move the grinding media as a fluid mass, and to overcome frictional losses. The increased number of impacts in our VIBRA-DRUM Grinding Mills result in a faster, more efficient grinding action. As the grinding mill vibrates, media particle migration is experienced in both axial and transverse directions.

## What is the origin of macroscopic friction? 
DISCUSSION. The macroscopic friction of mica was predicted on the basis of the DFT calculations and indentation hardness ( H = 6.27 0.26 GPa; see the Supplementary Materials). Macroscopic shear stress τ macro can be calculated as a function of normal stress σ macro as follows: τ macro = (μ + τ 0 / H) σ macro.

Figure 5 shows the atomic stick–slip behavior of friction for the SLG on mica with 0, 1, and 2 W intercalated layers. The friction loops with a scan distance of 4 nm, which are composed of trace and retrace signals, show the atomic stick–slip behavior at SLG + 0 W, SLG + 1 W, and SLG + 2 W in Fig. 5a–c.
