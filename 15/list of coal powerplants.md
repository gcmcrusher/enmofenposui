## How many coal power plants are there in the Philippines?
The major disadvantage of coal is its negative impact on the environment. Coal-burning energy plants are a major source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to carbon monoxide and heavy metals like mercury, the use of coal releases sulfur dioxide, a harmful substance linked to acid rain.

Coal fired power plants also known as coal fired power stations are facilities that burn coal to make steam in order to generate electricity.These stations, seen in Figure 1, provide ~40% of the world's electricity. Countries such as South Africa use coal for 94% of their electricity and China and India use coal for 70-75% of their electricity needs, however the amount of coal China
