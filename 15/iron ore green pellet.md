## The effect of particle size on green pellet properties of iron ore 
Abstract. Read online. Recently, the grade of iron ore deposits has deteriorated and further development of low grade deposits is desired. Presently, the most effective and often followed route taken to utilize such deposits is the provision of beneficiation plants for upgrading iron ore and pelletizing plants for agglomerating.

Bentonite in Iron-Ore Pellet Industry. During the pelletization process, the proportion of Bentonite added to Iron-ore is in the proportion of 0.5%. Adding bentonite improves the strength of the green pellet. The falling strength and compression strength of the green pellet increase as bentonite content increases.

## Computer vision
Iron ore green pellets are widely used in steel industry. In the manufacturing of green pellets in disc pelletizer, the pellet moisture (PM) should be frequently monitored to guarantee product quality. Current methods for PM measurement are off-line and time-consuming, which cannot meet the requirement for real-time measurement and control of pelletizing process. To solve
