## zinc ore beneficiation process
Aug 09, 2013 Mineral ore that suitable for deep processing are gold ore, copper ore, magnetite, manganese ore, lead-zinc deposit, etc. For most mineral mine, the processing capacity usually is not very large, the common crushing and beneficiation capacity are about 1 ton to 100 ton, so we can call them as small scale mineral ore process.

## Zinc smelting 
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc. Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals, e.g. iron, because in contrast, zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals, zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost, unless
