## The Second Phase of the Industrial Revolution: 1850–1940
An American businessman, William Kelly (1811–1888) of Eddyville, Kentucky, owned iron mines and also a furnace for making pig iron. In the early 1850s, he developed a steel-making process very similar to Bessemer's, but he did not apply for a patent until 1857, after Bessemer had received a patent in Britain.
