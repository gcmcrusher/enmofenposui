## How much CO2 and pollution comes from burning coal?
1,670 pounds of carbon dioxide. Coal's most notorious byproduct is carbon dioxide (CO2). Every million BTUs released from burning coal releases an average of 208 pounds of CO2 (see note below). Since a ton of coal has 20.025 million BTUs, that means it creates 4,172 pounds of CO2 when it is burned. Running our 100-watt bulb for one year will

## Is Burning coal is a combination reaction Why? 
What will speed up the reaction between coal and oxygen? Grinding a solid into a powder exposes atoms or molecules that were on the inside (carbon) to the outside (oxygen). Burning of coal, wood or leaves is also a chemical change. In fact, burning of any substance is a chemical change. Burning is always accompanied by production of heat.

## Burning Coal: Converting Chemical Energy Into Heat Energy
First the coal (1) is ground to a fine powder and blown into the boiler (2), where it is burned, converting its chemical energy into heat energy. Grinding the coal into powder increases its surface area, which helps it to burn faster and hotter, producing as much heat and as little waste as possible. As well as heat, burning coal produces ash
