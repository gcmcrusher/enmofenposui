## grinding media 
High-Chrome media has a superior performance and creates steady milling conditions due to its low wear rate. For each specific alloy there is a constant hardness of all grinding media. This creates a positive influence in the down-stream process. high-Chrome media is suitable for both wet and dry ore applications in ball mills and tower mills.
