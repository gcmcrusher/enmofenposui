Massive hematite ore (MHO) is a special high-grade iron ore used as lump ore in the process of obtaining direct reduced iron (DRI). The influence of porosity on the reducibility was investigated using optical and scanning electron microscopes. Hematite is the main component of the samples and occurs as granular crystals (10 m), microplates (1 m) and euhedral martite (10 to 30 m).

## Difference Between Magnetite and Hematite 
31/01/2018Key Terms: Crystal System, Ferromagnetic, Hematite, Iron, Magnetite, Ore, Paramagnetic. What is Magnetite. Magnetite is an iron ore where iron can be found in the form of Fe 3 O 4. Magnetite is ferromagnetic, which means, magnetite particles are attracted to an external magnetic field; magnetite particles can act like tiny magnets when magnetized.
