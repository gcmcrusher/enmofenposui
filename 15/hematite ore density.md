## Bulk Density as a Method to Evaluate Reducibility of Hard Hematite Ore 
Massive hematite ore (MHO) is a special high-grade iron ore used as lump ore in the process of obtaining direct reduced iron (DRI). The influence of porosity on the reducibility was investigated using optical and scanning electron microscopes. Hematite is the main component of the samples and occurs as granular crystals (10 m), microplates (1 m) and euhedral martite (10 to 30 m).
